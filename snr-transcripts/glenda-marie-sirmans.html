  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> In November 1969, the quiet suburban community of Farragut, Tennessee, was rocked by the disappearance of 13-year-old Glenda Marie Sirmans. Dressed in a green and white plaid coat with a fur collar, Glenda set out on foot to work on a school project with a friend. But when the friend called Glenda's mother to ask if she was still coming over, panic set in.</p>

  <p>Neighbors rallied to search for the young girl, but she was nowhere to be found. As the hours ticked by, Glenda's father contacted the police, and the search began in earnest.</p>

  <p>Authorities started looking for Glenda six hours after she was last seen, and a large search was conducted in western Knox County along Fort Loudon Lake.</p>

  <p>Friends described Glenda as a shy but happy eighth grader who would open up once you got to know her. One friend, Gilda Hodge, told police that Glenda talked about running away the previous summer, but hadn't mentioned it again. This gave authorities some hope that perhaps Glenda had run away rather than having been abducted - or worse.</p>

  <p>However, this hope was short lived. On December 14th, a dog returned to a home in Loudon County with a shoe that had a foot inside. Glenda's nude and maimed body was found on a wooded hillside about 100 yards off Lakeland Road, around 8 miles from her home.</p>

  <p>It's worth noting that one newspaper article reported that Lakeland was used as a lovers' lane, and as such, it wouldn't have stood out to neighbors if unknown cars were parked in the area at any point.</p>

  <p>According to the county coroner, Glenda's throat was cut, and she had an additional stab wound to the neck. It was immediately apparent to him that she was murdered. Because of the condition of the body, which had been mutilated by dogs, he was unable to determine whether or not Glenda had been sexually assaulted.</p>

  <p>Glenda's badly broken fingernails indicated she may have fought back against her killer. The sheriff said his investigators believed that the killer carried Glenda's body about 100 yards along a ridge to the spot where he or she left it, and that dogs dragged the body about 50 feet from there.</p>

  <p>Her clothing, hair, and other materials were scattered around the area, which authorities believed the dogs had done. Police also believed that Glenda was killed at the spot where her body was found, though they did not give the reason for this line of thinking.</p>

  <p>There are some discrepancies regarding the date of Glenda's death.</p>

  <p>According to one article, investigators believed that Glenda was held hostage for about two weeks before she was killed. And doctors ruled that she had only been dead 48 hours before she was found. Other articles assert that authorities believe she was killed the day she vanished. So the true timeline remains unclear.</p>

  <p>While Web Sleuths is not always a reliable source, it can still be worthwhile to gather information when dealing with an unsolved case.</p>

  <p>In the thread devoted to Glenda's case, a particular man had some interesting insights, claiming to be very close to the investigation. However, since these are just things someone said on the internet, they may not be entirely accurate.</p>

  <p>He said that while the police never named a suspect, there was someone who was always at the top of their list. This person of interest attended the same small church as Glenda, but died before the police could get anything concrete on him. Authorities never released the man's name, but evidently, he would have been known to the other church members as the church congregation was very small. Again, this is just someone's word on the internet, but it's interesting to consider.</p>

  <p>Glenda's murder is a tragic and unsolved case that has haunted the community for decades. While there are discrepancies and conflicting information, it's important to remember the victim and the impact her death has had on loved ones in the community. It's crucial that law enforcement and investigators continue to pursue leads and explore any potential evidence in order to bring closure to this case.</p>
