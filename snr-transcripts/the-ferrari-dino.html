  <p class="marker">[MUSIC]</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> You're gonna enjoy this. Because you're kind of a car person, right?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Okay.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah, I probably mentioned this somewhere in the story. I wrote it like a year ago… actually more than that. I think I wrote this before I left Nashville, but, just for our listeners, I don't know anything about cars. So nobody come at me if I say something stupid.</p>

  <p>Most of the bones of the story I'm going to tell here come from some really good reporting in these two articles by a guy named Mike Spinelli on the website Jalopnik. I guess it's a car website. So as far as sourcing here, you can go ahead and assume that's where I learned anything I tell you, unless I note otherwise. But as usual, there will be links to those articles and any other sources in the notes. Well, not in the notes on the app, but our show notes, and our show notes link is in the app.</p>

  <p>So, back in the late 70s, there was a buzz in the newspapers about a weird Ferrari story. And this tale involved a wealthy widow in Beverly Hills.</p>

  <p>So this widow, her name was Sandra Eileen West, and she passed away after an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. It's very sad, but before her death, she made a unique request. She wanted her body and her beloved 1964 Ferrari 330 America to be transported to San Antonio, Texas, where she would be laid to rest next to her late husband, of course, an oil man.</p>

  <p>This sounds very, very Texas so far, but here comes the really quirky part.</p>

  <p>So, West's body was placed in the driver's seat of the car, and the vehicle was then lowered into the burial plot. To ensure that the car wouldn't be stolen, they actually filled the burial plot with a significant amount of cement. That's kind of all there is to her story, and that's actually not the story I'm here to tell.</p>

  <p>It's a wild one, but instead we're going to be exploring another Ferrari tale that is different from West's, but has sort of a crucial similarity.</p>

  <p>I wrote here - I can't believe I wrote this in my script. I wrote, “I'm no gearhead." What?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> It is a word people use to like refer to people who are super into like cars, but I think specifically like the the parts of cars and engines and all that shit, like that are super into working on cars, and usually it's like fast cars. That's what I associate it with anyway.</p>

  <p>Well, I don't know what the Olivia of two years ago who wrote this was thinking. The point is - to sound more like myself here - I'm not like a big car enthusiast as I mentioned at the top, so I'm going to do my best to give the details here on the car we're talking about, but I'm going to be saying some things, and I have no idea what they mean.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Okay.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> So meet the star of our show, a dark green Ferrari Dino 2-4-6 GTS. Maybe it's a 246. I don't know. I'm no gearhead.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I'm gonna get you a shirt that says that.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I'll make one!</p>

  <p>So to my untrained eye, it looks like any other fancy sports car, but apparently it's got some noteworthy modifications. First up, it's got Campagnolo wheels. I'm also no Italian, so hopefully I got that right. But I'm told those were kind of a big deal in the world of lightweight car parts.</p>

  <p>It's also got some swanky seats from the Daytona model. Again, no idea what that means, but it might mean something to someone. So what's a Ferrari without a little luxury? So you want to modify it, I guess.</p>

  <p>This Dino's early days were nothing out of the ordinary. It was just another shiny sports car. It made its way from the Bay area, from some showroom to a Hollywood sports car dealership in 1974. And that October, a plumber named Rosendo Cruz bought the car as a birthday present for his wife. So he must have been doing a lot of plumbing, right?</p>

  <p>This was a $22,500 car - a gift. And I guess as of the last time I checked on inflation and what that price would be, it was back in April of 2023. At that time, that would amount to $133,000 today. So, yeah. A plumber, right?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Are we sure that's all this guy's doing?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I mean, everything is more expensive here. So maybe the plumbers are really making money. Maybe that's why my landlord never, you know, responds to any maintenance requests. Maybe all the maintenance people are just charging big Ferrari money.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Are we sure that this isn't like a front? like a organized crime thing where you have a business to like-</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Launder money? Maybe so.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> That's just a lot. I mean not that plumbers probably do make good money - and they should, for what they have to deal with.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Right, right.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> But that's a really expensive car.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Definitely. Well, as fate would have it, this wasn't gonna be a long lasting love story for Mrs. Cruz and her car anyway. On the day of their anniversary, these two folks, the Cruzes, found themselves with a missing Dino instead of a romantic night out.</p>

  <p>So, on December 7th, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz went out for an anniversary dinner at the legendary Brown Derby,  and not trusting the valet with the pricey sports car  - long before Ferris Bueller ever came around - Rosendo opted to park the car himself.</p>

  <p>So he left the Dino out on Wilshire Boulevard. And evidently thieves, maybe car enthusiasts with a taste for, I don't know, luxury, made away with the Dino.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> What year did you say it was? Sorry. I'm looking up a picture.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> 1974.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Oh this is a really cool car.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> It is, it is.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Oh, yeah, this is a cool fucking car.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah, I don't think I'd steal one, but I'd love to go for a ride.</p>

  <p>Evidently thieves, maybe some car enthusiast thieves made away with the Dino, leaving the Cruz family without a ride home and leaving Farmers Insurance with a hefty bill to pay. And like any insurance company, they paid up without a fuss. What? No. That's not most people's experience with insurance, right?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> With any insurance.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> They were just like, “Yeah, no, okay, I'm sorry your car got stolen. Here's a bunch of money.” But wait! There's more! This was not the end of the Dino's wild ride.</p>

  <p>So now we're gonna fast forward a few years to February, 1978.</p>

  <p>Back then, kids didn't have a bunch of screens to stare at, so they usually did exciting things to pass the time, like, I don't know, digging in the dirt? I'm being sarcastic, but actually, you know, digging in the dirt can be fun. I did it.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Yeah! Me too.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> But probably extra fun if you were kids digging in the front yard of a house in the West Adams part of L.A. that day when they hit something with a clang. And it looked suspiciously like they were unearthing a whole ass car. Yeah. In the front yard. Apparently, there was a Sheriff's deputy in the area for whatever reason, and they got his attention, and this wound up being the start of an investigation.</p>

  <p class="marker">[RECORD SCRATCH SOUND EFFECT]</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Wait, wait. That's how it was reported at the time. And it makes a good story, but that's not actually how authorities found the car.</p>

  <p>Based on a bit of investigation, Jalopnik founder Mike Spinelli, who I mentioned at the beginning, reported that the sheriff's department was actually tipped off by an informant.</p>

  <p>So, I don't, so maybe some kids didn't find it, but I like that story better. In any case, it's not every day that you dig up a Ferrari in a front yard. So that did happen. It was buried in a front yard. I just- it probably wasn't kids playing in the dirt.</p>

  <p>So the informant alleged that the car's owner, Mr. Cruz, had some guys steal the car at the Brown Derby. Maybe he was regretting that big purchase. And the thieves were supposed to chop up the car for parts and dump whatever was left. However, it seemed like the thieves were maybe a little too enamored with the car and didn't want to cut it up, dismember it, and maybe buried it in the hope that they could safely dig it up one day at some later date, and I don't know, drive it, sell it, whatever. But for whatever reason, They did not come back for it.</p>

  <p class="marker">[BUMPER]</p>

  <p class="marker">[AD BREAK]</p>

  <p class="marker">[BUMPER]</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> What's the craziest thing you've ever found?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Buried?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Or, yeah, I mean, in that sort of vein, like, you found sort of unintentionally, that wasn't yours.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I mean, everybody finds marbles. I don't know - why are there so many marbles in the dirt?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Maybe it's where kids used to play them all the time. And they would do it, yeah, like, in like a little dirt circle or whatever.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Maybe so. One of the most fun things that I've found - so my dad's old house was up on this hill in West Nashville, and if you kind of hiked up the hill, it was a little hard to get up there, and there wasn't like a trail or anything, but you could hike up there. And one time I found a beer can, but this was an old-</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I love this.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> It was - you know how they used to have those little tabs you pulled off the top? So it was old but that's not the best part. The best part - this isn't going to be known to everybody, it's going to be known to people who lived in the region with Kroger grocery stores in the 80s - it was Cost Cutter brand. Like yellow and black label. It was Cost Cutter beer.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I remember this.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I don't even remember generic beer being around back then, but I also was a small child. I wasn't buying beer in the 80s. So, I found one of those.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Did you take it?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> No, I think I left it. It was kind of gross, but another time I found - and I did save this for a long time, eventually I got rid of it - but an old Instamatic - I think that's Kodak - an old Instamatic camera buried somewhere in this place. It may have even been off a trail. It was over at Bells Bend Park, and that was really cool, and I wanted to clean it up. I never did really clean it up. I don't think it would have worked. I don't think you could have restored it, but it looked really cool.</p>

  <p>So off the top of my head, those were probably the most interesting things I can think of.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I don't know that I ever found anything too interesting. I do remember as a kid though, and I don't know if you remember this, and if it's even what it should be called anymore, but when you were a kid was like Indian money a big deal? Do you remember that?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yes.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> And I would go looking for that all the time.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> There is a name for what it is, because I felt like we probably wouldn't call it that now, but it's because it's some kind of organism.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Right. That's why I prefaced what I said with that.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah. Hopefully our listeners know that we're not assholes. And there's a ton of it where my mom lives because her husband digs it up all the time and he would save it.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Is it a type of like fossil?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> It is. It's a fossil. It's some kind of-</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> That's what I thought.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> -sea creature or something.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> But when I was a kid, I was super into looking for that.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> There's a ton, but it's, it's some kind of creature or plant life. It's a fossil and it I can't remember the name, but I'm 99 percent sure I wouldn't be able to pronounce it if I could. But yeah, they look like little stacks of coins kind of.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Yes. Yes, yes, yes.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> And I don't know if everybody listening would even know about that.</p>

  <p>I don't know if that's only in certain regions or what.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Yeah, I don't know. I just thought about that just now. But I remember there was a period of time as a kid that I was super into it. Like I, for some reason, always looked for it. But other than that, I don't know that i've ever… I will say i'm the weirdo that if I'm - especially if it's somewhere like in the woods or like you're walking on a trail or whatever I've found weird stuff like notes, and I've found cards and stuff before, and I'm that weird person that I'll take it and save them. Sometimes when I'm going through my stuff, which I've been doing a lot of the last couple years I'll find them, and I'm like, “Where the hell? What the hell is this?” And then I'm like, “Oh, this is probably just some weird thing that I found on the ground.”</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> That reminds me of a really good find I had. It wasn't something hidden like that. It was out waiting to be found, and I'll have to find the note that was on it and read it in a future episode. But anybody that follows me on Instagram may have actually seen the story I did where I read this note.</p>

  <p>I found a snake plant out on Franklin Avenue over here, almost in Hollywood. So, it was, a bunch of woo woo shit about “this plant's not a trauma dump.”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> What? Oh yeah, that's right.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah, and it's thriving here now, so in a future episode maybe I'll find that note and read it.</p>

  <p>It seems that the people living in the house where the car was found had only been there for three months, so they had no clue how it wound up there.</p>

  <p>Likewise, no neighbors had seen anything weird at the residence around the time the car went missing. I don't blame them for not seeing anything suspicious. It's not like they were gonna to be out on the street in the middle of the night keeping an eye out for people burying Ferraris. But still…</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> But you think you'd hear it.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah, I mean, this is like the second largest city in the U. S., and I feel like, especially in a front yard, you'd think someone might've noticed a group of guys burying a car, but I don't know, maybe it was late at night. Honestly, it seems like things are actually pretty quiet here late at night, so maybe no one was out and noticed.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Well, but also how'd they get it in there?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I don't know how they got it in there. I mean, you'd think you'd have to use like a backhoe to dig a hole like that. That's the real mystery to me.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Then you would have to like, I would think, unless they just like, pushed it in and it, cause I don't know how they found it in the hole, but if it was like, just sitting in the hole, they would have to have lowered it down somehow. And that would be loud! And it would need equipment! Who wouldn't notice?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I cannot explain that, and unfortunately, spoiler alert: I'm not gonna have any answers on that. So, maybe they were just really amazing at keeping a low profile. But, anyway, even if the car wasn't found by kids, it was found. And it was buried for years.</p>

  <p>So, let's move on and find out what condition the Dino was in when it was retrieved.</p>

  <p>It looks like Sheriff's Department detectives Joe Sabas and Dennis Carroll hit the jackpot. So they uncovered the stolen Ferrari Dino, and unlike most crime stories that involve buried cars, there was not a single dead body in sight, so yay for that! What a relief.</p>

  <p>But we still have some details that we gotta discuss about the car's condition. There's some sort of clickbaity mentions out there about this and they're like, “The car was in perfect condition!” Well, no, it wasn't. But it seemed like whoever buried it was planning to come back for it and they were really serious about protecting it from whatever critters are underground. They went all out, they stuffed towels into every little part you could think of, and they covered it with plastic like they were packing up for a camping trip or something. So that kept it somewhat intact. And it had a license plate on it, So that made it easy for them to link it up to the theft report from when it was originally stolen.</p>

  <p>I searched and searched, but I couldn't find any mention of charges against the car's owner, Mr Cruz, after that. So I don't know, maybe the informant was lying when they said he set up the theft. Maybe. But the theft of the car is not really the interesting part of the story.</p>

  <p>I mean, it does make you wonder why someone, you know, with a blue collar job- how they're buying a car like that. But I think the fact that this car was buried is what's really interesting. But it was eventually released to the Hollywood branch of the Bank of America. It's their car now. But not. Because the Bank of America had received the insurance payout for the Dino after the initial report of the theft.</p>

  <p>I guess they were the ones who did the car loan and so after the insurance payout, the money went to them. So they handed it over to Farmers Insurance, who was the car's rightful owner at that point. And the insurance company planned to auction it off.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Okay.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Because the LA Times reported the car to be in, quote, “surprisingly good condition,” people were just clamoring to get their hands on it.</p>

  <p>But, like I mentioned, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. For reasons passing understanding, whoever stuffed those towels between the windows didn't actually roll them up all the way. So, that made a huge mess.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Oh no!</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah, I'm sure dirt and shit was getting in there. Maybe earthworms.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> What about like, yeah, critters? What about critters?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I don't know, do you guys have like moles there? And gophers?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I don't know. I've been here more a year and a half now, and I'm still asking these things.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> There's gotta be worms, right?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Sure. Before I moved, I googled, “Do they have biscuits in California?” Or I had to see if they had Duke's.</p>


  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> They do, but no offense, most of them suck. Like, almost all the biscuits that I've eaten when I've been out there are dry as hell.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> The South gets a lot wrong, but food ain't it.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> No, that's one of the things we've got going for us.</p>
  
  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> The extraction process from that LA yard left the car worse for the wear with a partially crushed hood, scratches on the roof, and a busted windshield. So it looks like it went through a rough ride, literally.</p>

  <p>Despite all of that, there's one thing we can be grateful for - the drought that hit from 1976 through part of 1978. So, yay drought, I guess.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Why was that good?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Well, for preservation of the car. Sometimes mother nature can be on our side, and in this case, the lack of moisture helped preserve the Dino pretty well. So the next time that you're stuck in a drought, just think about how it could be a blessing in disguise for that classic car buried in your yard.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it looks like Farmer's Insurance's plan to auction off the buried Dino was not exactly a smashing success.</p>

  <p>So as you might guess, the car was in such rough shape that they decided to let potential buyers have a look before they placed their bids, which sounds pretty fair. Sounds like a smart move, but maybe not so much. At least not the way they did it. After two weeks of being on display in a Pasadena warehouse, the Dino was returned to Farmer's, as Jalopnik put it, quote, “missing almost everything not bolted down, including the dipstick.” Who steals a fucking dipstick?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> A dipstick?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> That's right.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> A dipstick enthusiast.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I guess somebody really wanted to make sure they could check their oil level with stolen car parts. I don't know.</p>

  <p>Well, that theft is just the cherry on top of the sundae of problems that plagued this poor car. There were white spots on the paint and rust holes in the body, which, that makes sense, being buried. And the leather interior, which I guess that's part of those special seats they had put in, was just a complete fucking mess. It's unbelievable anybody even wanted to buy it, but I guess that's sort of the beauty of classic cars. Even when they're not in the best condition, there's something special about them that makes people want to bring them back to life, and that's why people love restoring old cars.</p>

  <p>Luckily, the Dino's story has a happy ending after all. Despite being in pretty rough shape when it was first dug up, the car found its way into the hands of a businessman named Brad Howard, and he really worked some magic on it. He didn't just give the Dino a quick wash and a new coat of paint.</p>

  <p>He had it restored to its former glory. And a lot of work went into the restoration, but it was really all worth it in the end. It is now back in tip top shape. It looks better than ever. And he even gave it a vanity plate that says “DUG UP” on it as a nod to this car's history.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Oh my god. I love that.</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah, totally. And he doesn't just keep the car in a garage and bring it out for an occasional car show. He actually drives it around, which, I mean, wouldn't you? I would love to. But can you imagine seeing it out on the road, and if you knew its history? I'd do a double take.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Does he live there? In California?</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> As far as I know. It's been a minute since I read the article about it, but I would assume so. I'll have to dig into that. Oh, God, I regret saying that.</p>

  <p>So that's it. The Dino it had a rough start in life, but it ended up in the hands of somebody who truly appreciated it. And thanks to a lot of hard work, it's a real beauty. And maybe one day it'll end up in a museum.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Yeah, they should put it in that Peterson-</p>

  <span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Peterson Museum! I still haven't been there. I just want to go into their parking garage because I know they've filmed some Terminator 2 stuff in there. I feel like a real nerd for knowing that.</p>

  <p>But for now, it's just nice to know that the little Ferrari that was once buried underground has found a happy home.</p>
