  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> A quick note before we get started: from the beginning, you're going to hear me seemingly mangle, a Spanish word. In fact, it's the name of the neighborhood where I live - and where this crime took place. The neighborhood's name should be pronounced Los Fey-leez, but for whatever reason, people here call it Los Fee-liz.</p>

  <p>On a quiet Monday morning in February of 1948, real estate agent Fred Lyon arrived at the large hillside home located at 4217 Cromwell Avenue in the affluent Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. With six spacious rooms and stunning views, the property was on the market for a hefty $25,000 - small fortune in those days. Lyon was there to show the house to a prospective buyer, but what he found inside was far from what he expected.</p>

  <p>In the kitchen sprawled out on the floor, was the lifeless body of a woman. The circumstances surrounding her death were unclear, and the police were about to be drawn into a case that would baffle investigators for decades to come.</p>

  <p>Gladys Kern was born Gladys Eugenia O'Neill in 1905 in the heartland of America: Kansas. By the time she met her untimely end in the kitchen of the Cromwell Avenue house, she'd lived a full life. She was 42 years old and had worked as a real estate agent in the bustling city of Los Angeles. Gladys lived with her husband, John Edward Kern, in the vibrant Highland Park neighborhood - an eclectic mix of cultures and styles. John was a toolmaker, and the couple had two grown children, Jack and Peggy, who had recently left the nest to start their own families.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there's not much more information available about Gladys' life. We don't know what her hobbies were, or what kind of person she was. But we do know that she was loved by her family and that her husband told police that she had no enemies. Despite this, the investigation into her murder was intense, and police worked tirelessly to uncover the truth behind her death. Over the next few weeks, they would make shocking discoveries that would lead them down a rabbit hole of mystery and intrigue.</p>

  <p>The evidence found at the crime scene suggests that Gladys Kern was stabbed with a 6-inch hunting knife that was later found in the kitchen sink. The knife had been thoroughly washed, but a bloodstained handkerchief was found in the sink or under it, depending on which report you're reading, leading investigators to suspect it was used to wipe the knife. However, the handkerchief had no laundry markings that could trace it back to its owner.</p>

  <p>Gladys' watch, a two-toned yellow gold and platinum timepiece with diamonds and the engraving "Peggy Ann" on the back, was missing from the crime scene, as well as her purse, which was described as plastic. Her wallet, containing only six cents, was found beside her. Police asked pawn shops and jewelers to keep an eye out for the missing watch.</p>

  <p>Police technician Ray Pinker planned to examine the knife and purse for fingerprints, but was only able to determine that the purse had been held by, quote, "wet hands," suggesting that someone had rifled through it after washing the knife. A photo of a man with Gladys was found either in her purse or desk, and investigators sought to identify him.</p>

  <p>Gladys car was parked in front of the house, and neighbors had not seen her arrive. So it was unclear whether she had arrived alone or with someone else. No one heard anything at the time of the murder, according to reports from the Long Beach Independent.</p>

  <p>We have a rough timeline of the day Gladys was last seen, which suggests she may have been killed in the late afternoon, two days before her body was found on Valentine's Day, February 14th, 1948. John last saw Gladys at the Roy Street home around 5:30 a.m. as he was leaving for work. Later that day, Gladys got a key for the Cromwell Avenue house from real estate agent John H. Gregg at approximately 1 p.m. According to the Independent, she told Gregg that she planned to show the house to a prospective buyer.</p>

  <p>Sometime in the afternoon, likely around 2 p.m., Gladys was seen at a drugstore soda fountain near her office with a man. The store manager, Mary Johnson, described him as having very dark hair and a medium build, and he was wearing a blue suit. This matched the description of her alleged killer given in an anonymous note. In his first Black Dahlia Avenger book, former homicide detective Steve Hodel said that the two sat at the counter having a soda and then left. Johnson said she had not seen this man before or since that day.</p>

  <p>William E. Osborne, a radar engineer who worked in the same building as Gladys, saw her in the office talking with a large man around 3:15 p.m., after which they left the office together. According to Hodel's book, Osborne told police that it seemed like maybe Gladys and the man already knew each other as, quote, "They were talking generalities, not business."</p>

  <p>A neighbor then spotted Gladys' car parked at the Cromwell Avenue house at about 3:30 p.m. Osborne told investigators that Gladys returned to the office alone, but he saw her leave again around 4:30 p.m. That was the last listed sighting of Gladys Kern, and police believed that she probably arranged to meet the mystery client at the Cromwell house after leaving the office.</p>

  <p>That evening, her husband John returned to their Roy Street home after work. He found a note from Gladys reminding him to dress up for a wedding they planned to attend that evening. He fell asleep while waiting for her to return, but woke up when their kids, Jack and Peggy Ann, stopped by to see if their parents wanted to ride with them to the wedding.</p>

  <p>John told his kids that he was going to stay at the house and wait for Gladys, but he fell asleep again and didn't wake up until the next morning. When he realized that Gladys had not yet returned home, he and the children contacted the LAPD to report her missing. The family's concern was heightened by the fact that Gladys had never gone missing before and always made sure to be home for her family.</p>

  <p>Earlier we mentioned an anonymous note. On Sunday, February 15th, the day before Gladys Kern's body was discovered, a mail carrier found a note in a downtown Los Angeles mailbox at Fifth and Olive Streets. The note was, quote, "printed laboriously in pencil on cheap typing paper," according to the Los Angeles Times, and was folded and glued shut instead of being in an envelope. It was labeled with, quote, "HURRY GIVE TO POLICE." The note didn't name Gladys or provide any details about the location of the crime, so the police couldn't take any action on that day. However, they later made the connection when Gladys was found. The note must have been dropped in the mailbox sometime in the later part of February 14th.</p>

  <p>I'll read the note now, lightly edited for clarity:</p>

  <p>"I made the acquaintance of a man three weeks ago while in Griffith Park. He seemed a great sport. We got friendly Friday night. He asked me if I wanted to make about $300. He said he wanted to buy a home for his family, but he was a racketeer and no real estater would do business with him.</p>

  <p>He suggested I buy a home for him in my name. Then he would go with the person to look at the property to make sure he liked it. And I was to tell the real estater that he was lending me the cash, so he had to inspect, and I waited outside.</p>

  <p>After a while, I went up to investigate. There I found her lying on the floor, him trying to take rings off her fingers. He pulled a gun on me and told me he just knocked her out. He knew I carried money, so he took my wallet with all my money, tied my hands with my belt, let me lay down on the sink, and attached the belt to the faucet.</p>

  <p>After he left, I got free and tried to revive her. I turned her over. I was covered with blood, pulled the knife out, then suddenly I came to. I washed my hands and the knife, and then I looked in her bag for her home phone and address. Then left and ran out.</p>

  <p>While inside I found he put a small pocketbook in my coat pocket and threw it away. Also in my pocket was an old leather strap.</p>

  <p>I knew this man as Louis Frazer. He has a 36 or 37 Pontiac four door, very dark. Number plates look like '46 plates, but with '48 stickers, about five foot 10, jet black curly hair, wears a blue or tan gabardine suit. He told me he was a fighter. And looks it.</p>

  <p>I won't rest till I find him. I know every place we went together. I know that man is my only alibi and without him I feel equally guilty."</p>

  <p>After reading the full text of the anonymous note published in Steve Hodel's book, it's clear that the author had been at the crime scene. The note was sent for fingerprinting, but technician Ray Pinker couldn't find any suspect prints due to too many police having handled it.</p>

  <p>The scenario described in the note about washing his hands and looking in Gladys's purse is consistent with the evidence found by Pinker that the purse had been handled by, quote, "wet hands." Furthermore, the note was dropped in the mail before anyone even realized that Gladys was missing.</p>

  <p>However, the name of the alleged killer given in the note, Louis Frazer, did not lead to any breakthroughs. Investigators were unable to find anyone by that name in their files or records of boxers, leaving the case with yet another frustrating dead end.</p>

  <p>There were a number of descriptions provided by people who had seen Gladys with an unknown man the day she was killed. There were some variations, particularly when it came to age. But all were consistent with describing his hair as dark or black and wavy or curly.</p>

  <p>The L.A. Times reported that police pulled together a description based on the different sightings as follows:</p>

  <p>"White, 23 to 26, 5 foot 7, good-looking, black wavy hair, dark brown close set eyes, clean shaven, sharp features, hollow cheeks, courteous, fair complexion, midwestern accent, possible Italian extraction."</p>

  <p>The LAPD's Hollywood Division reportedly gained a quote, "mystery informant," less than a week after the murder, according to the Los Angeles Times. The informant was said to be a real estate agent who claimed to have details about a possible sale Gladys was working on for the Cromwell Avenue house. As police couldn't find any written records on the house or prospective buyers in her purse or desk, the tip could have been incredibly helpful.</p>

  <p>The strange thing about this report is that the informant offered to give investigators information on the potential sale as long as he could remain anonymous, a condition to which the cops agreed. However, shortly after that, the Los Angeles Evening Citizen News published an article stating that officers knew nothing about the mystery man real estate agent. It's unclear how this unsubstantiated claim made it into a major newspaper, but it's likely not a reliable lead for the investigation.</p>

  <p>Upon the return of Faye L. Cook, Gladys boss, from a trip out of town, she provided the police with a list of over 200 prospective buyers for the Cromwell Avenue house. Investigators quickly narrowed the list down to just 30 names, and they were confident that the killer was among them. According to the LA Times, most of the names on the list were male, with two of them having inquired about the house on the same day as Gladys' murder.</p>

  <p>Despite not finding any matches on the list to the description of the man seen with Gladys, Cook believed that Gladys would have noted his name. As part of her routine, Gladys would always verify the potential buyer's identity before documenting any information about them. She was always known to be meticulous in her documentation. So it was likely that if she had met the killer before, his name would be in her notes.</p>

  <p>On February 18th, homicide detectives had a glimmer of hope when they questioned two men in connection with the case. The first man was held by Long Beach investigators, while the second was picked up by detectives in Highland Park. According to the Daily News, Both men were initially considered persons of interest based on their resemblance to the suspect description.</p>

  <p>The Long Beach man closely matched a police composite of the suspect and was said to be a house hunter. Meanwhile, the Highland Park man was known to frequently visit an address just one block from Gladys; home and had a criminal record.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, we have no further information on how these interviews turned out, but it's safe to assume that the police found no connection between these men and the murder. As we will see, other suspects would be investigated later.</p>

  <p>On February 20th, the coroner's inquest into Gladys murder was held. However, according to the Highland Park News Herald, the proceeding failed to produce the name of a suspect, and no groundbreaking new information came out of it. But, at the same time, police sent out an updated suspect description as part of an all points bulletin. The witness, William E. Osborne, who saw Gladys leave her office for the last time, provided details for the updated description. The description was transcribed in Steve Hodel's book and reads as follows:</p>

  <p>"Male, approximately 50 years of age, 6 feet tall, long, full face, graying hair, wearing a business suit with a moderate cut. Well-dressed and neat, with a New York appearance in his dress and manner."</p>

  <p>Gladys Kern's tragic and untimely death left her family and friends in mourning, and her funeral was a somber affair that brought together loved ones and acquaintances alike.</p>

  <p>The service was held on February 21st, 1948. It's difficult to imagine the pain and sorrow felt by those in attendance as they said goodbye to a woman who had been taken from them far too soon. But in the midst of their grief, they surely found some comfort in being together, and in knowing that they were there to honor and remember the life of a person who had meant so much to them.</p>

  <p class="marker">[BUMPER]</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> The investigation into Gladys Kern's murder brought up two potential suspects, both of whom remain unnamed. </p>

  <p>The first suspect, who I'll refer to as the Hotel Man, was a World War II veteran who matched the description of the killer provided in the anonymous note that was found at the scene. According to an informant who spoke with police, the Hotel Man always carried a hunting knife and lived in a downtown Los Angeles hotel, near the mailbox where the anonymous note was found. He left his job without giving notice and on the day he left, he cashed his paycheck but left his wife behind without any money. The police requested help from the FBI and state identification agencies to examine handwriting samples, fingerprints, and a photo of a person of interest, presumably the man the informant had in mind.</p>

  <p>It's unclear what happened next with the Hotel Man, and there's no public information on whether the police were able to locate or speak with him. It's also worth noting that the Hotel Man may be the same person as the Piano Man, another suspect who was sought after more than two years later.</p>

  <p>According to a May 1950 report in the Los Angeles Times, detectives were looking for a piano player who had left Los Angeles for Texas. The police described the piano player as, quote, "tall, handsome, the kind women go for." Two LAPD homicide detectives traveled to Houston and Dallas to look for the Piano Man, but missed him in both locations. The police believed they knew where the person of interest was, but declined to tell the press where they got the tip. The piano player had been playing in small bands throughout Houston for about eight months, according to the Long Beach Independent.</p>

  <p>Both the Daily Press Journal out of Wilmington, California, and the Los Angeles Mirror reported that the piano player was also being looked at as a suspect in the murder of Elizabeth Short, better known as the Black Dahlia. However, the police seemed to dismiss the idea that he was involved in Short's murder, as they were unsure if he was even in Los Angeles at the time. It's worth noting that the Black Dahlia case and Gladys Kern's murder were both high profile cases that garnered a lot of attention from the media and the public, and there was immense pressure on the police to find the suspects and make arrests.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it's not clear whether the police ever spoke to the piano player, and his identity remains unknown. It's possible that he had nothing to do with Gladys Kern's murder or the Black Dahlia case and was simply a person of interest in both investigations.</p>

  <p>In May of 1950, detectives received a tip that two former roommates who had lived in an apartment on Sunset, located close to Gladys's office, might know something about the stolen watch. H.E. Kenyon, who was working as a cab driver in Lansing, Michigan, at the time, and Frank Hanna, a printer in Beaumont, Texas, were asked to come to Los Angeles to meet with detectives. Kenyon had a record for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, while Hannah had been arrested for drunkenness. The police also planned to question them about the murder of Elizabeth Short.</p>

  <p>According to the Los Angeles Mirror, Kenyon and Hannah voluntarily came forward and traveled to Los Angeles to speak with detectives. However, they were subsequently released after investigators determined that they didn't have any helpful information to provide, despite having business dealings with Gladys. The nature of these dealings was not disclosed, but it's possible that Gladys had helped them secure the apartment rental. The men were also found to have no connection to Elizabeth Short.</p>

  <p>It is worth noting that the police were looking into possible connections between Gladys' murder and the Black Dahlia case, as several individuals were questioned in both investigations. However, as we will see later, there is no evidence linking the two cases.</p>

  <p>Before and after Gladys Kern's murder, there were several incidents that bear similarities to her case, with the first four appearing to be the most likely related.</p>

  <p>On February 7th, 1948, an unnamed female real estate agent was attacked and robbed in Redondo Beach, 25 miles south of Los Feliz. The perpetrator, described as a man with black wavy hair, threatened the woman with a long knife, forced her to undress, and locked her in a bathroom. Redondo police declined to speak to the media about the attack, despite the similarity in the description of the attacker and M.O. between the two cases.</p>

  <p>Around February 20th, Bertram Dresser, a 67-year-old man, reported to police that he went with two prospective buyers to show a property he owned. The two men tried to make him cash a $500 check. And on the way back, Dresser directed them on a path that passed the Inglewood Police Station. He then jumped out of the car as they went by it. The car was a late model blue sedan.</p>

  <p>On February 25th, a man with dark hair who looked to be around 34 or 35 walked into the office of a Long Beach real estate agent and inquired about buying real estate or apartment rentals. However, he then pulled a hunting knife on her and went through her purse, only managing to steal one dollar. She told the attacker that her husband had just pulled up to the office door, causing him to flee. The attacker was described as a man with dark hair and seen leaving in a gray 1940 Plymouth coupe.</p>

  <p>A few hours later, another real estate agent in Manhattan Beach was approached by a man with a similar description who had asked to be shown vacant lots for sale. The agent drove him around and showed him several lots, after which he asked to see, quote, "more isolated property." She took him to a deserted area where he pulled a large knife on her and said, "Alright now!" The woman jumped from her moving vehicle and ran to a nearby house where she called police as the attacker sped off in her car. She described the attacker as a man with dark curly hair, weighing around 140 pounds, and arriving in her office in a dirty gray coupe. Her car was located about six blocks from where she jumped out, with her purse still inside, missing two dollars and fifty cents. The man retrieved his own car at her office.</p>

  <p>The Bertram Dresser incident seems unrelated to the other incidents based on the car description and number of attackers. However, the Long Beach and Manhattan Beach robberies were likely carried out by the same person, given their proximity in time and location, M.O., and the description of both the suspect and his car.</p>

  <p>It's possible that any or all of these incidents are related to Gladys Kern's murder. The commonality through all four of these robberies is that no one was killed or physically harmed by the perpetrator. Therefore, if one, all, or some combination of these attacks was perpetrated by the same person who killed Gladys, it's logical to conclude that her death was not part of the plan. It appears that the robber or robbers in these cases used the threat of violence to get money, indicating that money was the point, not violence or murder. In Gladys' case, the perpetrator may have killed her in a panic if she fought back or if he felt threatened in some other way. This explanation does not excuse his crime, but it provides a possible reason why a series of crimes might be related, even though only one of them resulted in a death.</p>

  <p>It's worth noting here that Redondo Beach, Long Beach, and Manhattan Beach are all a considerable distance from Los Feliz, as Los Angeles County covers more than 4,000 square miles. Many serial offenders tend to attack in the same area over and over again. So if the South Bay attacks were all committed by the same person, a similar attack 20 or 30 miles away would have been a considerable break in the pattern.</p>

  <p>There's no resolution to any of these incidents based on available research.</p>

  <p>If you look up Gladys Kern, you're going to run across articles regarding the 1949 disappearance of a wealthy widow, Mimi Boomhower.</p>

  <p>Boomhower was selling her 10 room Bel Air home, and was actively taking appointments to show it in August of 1949. On August 18th, she canceled some plans, but spoke to a friend by phone that night. Which was the last anyone ever heard from her. Two days later, a friend went to her home to check on her, but of course she wasn't there. The lights were left on, her car was in the garage, and an uneaten salad was found on her dining room table, but the house was in order. Boomhower always wore expensive jewelry, including a diamond ring worth $5,000, which would be more than $63,000 today. So robbery was certainly a possibility.</p>

  <p>According to her listing on the Doe Network website, 5 days after Boomhower's disappearance, her white purse was found in a telephone booth at a Los Angeles grocery store. Someone had written directly on the purse, "Police Department, we found this at beach Thursday night." Thursday being the night she went missing. The purse contained cosmetics, Boomhower's ID, and a credit card, but no evidence of sand or salt water.</p>

  <p>Mimi Boomhower was never found.</p>

  <p>Honestly, I don't find her case a compelling match for a connection to Gladys' death. The two women were close in age, and both cases had a real estate angle, but Boomhower disappeared and not a trace of her has been found in more than 70 years. To me, the idea of killing a woman during a real estate showing and leaving her body to be found, and then kidnapping another woman in a similar scenario with her body never being found is just too different in terms of M.O. I wouldn't say absolutely that I don't believe the two are related, but they're different enough that it feels unlikely to me.</p>

  <p>There were two other incidents that were mentioned in newspapers as potentially connected to Gladys Kern's murder, but they were ultimately resolved and didn't seem to have anything to do with it.</p>

  <p>The first incident occurred weeks before Gladys was killed. George Judd Sr., a 55-year-old executive of a bond and mortgage company, was found dead in the bedroom of his Pasadena home. According to the Pasadena Independent, his throat was cut with a bread knife, which had been cleaned and left in the kitchen sink. His watch was stolen and his wallet emptied, but no one was seen arriving or leaving near the time of the murder.</p>

  <p>Although Judd's job at a mortgage company could be seen as a loose connection to Gladys' murder, the circumstances surrounding his death were quite different. Additionally, a young man who knew Judd, already confessed to the killing, making it unlikely to be related to Gladys murder.</p>

  <p>In September of 1950, the Daily News reported that Maureen Waite, a 47-year-old woman from Ontario, 40 miles east of Los Angeles, left home at 9 a.m. and said she would be back in about an hour. When she didn't return, her husband suspected foul play and reported her missing.</p>

  <p>At first glance, this might seem to match the crime against Gladys, but Maureen showed up back at home about a week later, seemingly unharmed. She didn't reveal where she'd been, but it appeared that she had not been the victim of a crime.</p>

  <p>Steve Hodel, the retired LAPD homicide detective and author I mentioned earlier, is known for his theory that his father, Dr. George Hodel, was the killer of the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short. He also believes his father may have been responsible for other murders of women, including Gladys Kern and Mimi Boomhower.</p>

  <p>In Black Dahlia Avenger, Hodel categorized different murders according to the strength of the connection between his father and the crime. He included Gladys murder in the category called, quote, "Definite or extremely strong evidence."</p>

  <p>Hodel claimed that handwriting expert Hannah McFarland identified the handwriting on the anonymous note about Gladys' murder and the message on Mimi Boomhower's purse as belonging to Dr. George Hodel, and that no handwriting experts had refuted this claim.</p>

  <p>Hodel also mentioned that Gladys home, where she was killed, was only 1.1 miles from his father's home at the Sowden House. Additionally, He cited the proximity of the mailbox where the anonymous note about Gladys was dropped to his father's office at 7th and Flower Streets in downtown Los Angeles, noting that a message about Elizabeth Short was also mailed from that same box. Hodel claimed that the current note was presented in a similar manner to the Dahlia note, as it was folded and glued shut, rather than placed in an envelope.</p>

  <p>Hodel also believed that the knife used in Gladys murder belonged to an acquaintance who stayed in his father's home, and he suggested that the handle of the knife found at the scene was translucent, possibly made of resin and had some small paint flaws. However, the photo published in the newspaper around the time of the crime showed a 6-inch blade, rather than the 8-inch blade Hodel claimed, and the handle appeared to be leather wrapped.</p>

  <p>Hodel also noted that the handkerchief found at the scene of Gladys murder had no laundry markings, suggesting that the owner did laundry at home, and that his father had a woman who worked in his home and did his laundry.</p>

  <p>In Black Dahlia Avenger, Hodel claimed that LAPD had confirmed that physical evidence in both Elizabeth Short and Gladys Kern's murder had disappeared. Without this evidence, it's impossible to determine if DNA could be collected from the handkerchief or the anonymous note, if the knife handle could be examined more closely, or if the photo of Gladys and the unidentified man could be checked to see if the man looked like George Hodel.</p>

  <p>Hodel's supposed connections between his father and Gladys murder just aren't compelling enough to make me consider him a suspect. However, in his book, Hodel said investigators for the DA were looking at his father in connection with Gladys murder. I ran across no other sources stating as much, and no newspaper descriptions of the people police were considering match George Hodel. What I did find, though, was that persons of interest who were questioned about Gladys murder were noted to also be questioned about Elizabeth Short's murder. Perhaps Steve Hodel misinterpreted that information since it is a fact that his father was on police radar in the Black Dahlia murder.</p>

  <p>I think it's important to note here that in discussing suspects in Gladys' case who were also being questioned about the Black Dahlia murder, the Daily News said, quote, "It has become standard operating procedure to question all persons in any way connected with a homicide investigation about this case," - "this case" meaning the Black Dahlia.</p>

  <p>As we wrap up this discussion, I'd like to share a few more thoughts, particularly on Steve Hodel's theories. However, I've got to make it clear, I'm no expert on this case or its surrounding theories. While I'm deeply interested in the case, there are many people who have studied it extensively and have strong opinions on it. That said, I have some reservations about his theories.</p>

  <p>I believe that George Hodel is a reasonable suspect in Elizabeth Short's murder. And the Sowden house in Los Feliz, where he lived, is a chilling reminder to me personally of the possibility of Short's murder happening there, because I live yards from it. However, I don't believe that Steve Hodel's theories connecting his father to some other murders hold up to scrutiny. While I haven't studied these other cases in detail, the evidence he presents seems kind of unconvincing. Perhaps in his attempt to expose his father's dark past, he's stretched the evidence a little bit too thin.</p>

  <p>Regarding Gladys Kern's murder, I'm not convinced that George Hodel was responsible. Steve Hodel's evidence doesn't sway me.</p>

  <p>As for the anonymous note left at the crime scene, my initial reaction was that the killer wrote it to mislead investigators. Steve Hodel's explanation that the misspellings and handwriting changes were intentional does seem plausible to me. However, Hodel also mentions in his book an eyewitness account of two men leaving the scene together, and that's hard to ignore. I don't have an explanation for this, and I don't discount the possibility that there were two perpetrators. But I'm not sure how the idea of two perpetrators lines up for Hodel in terms of his theory that his father killed Gladys.</p>

  <p>Despite all the investigations, theories, and speculation, we're left with more questions than answers about Gladys Kern's murder. It's a haunting reminder of the violent crime that took place in the heart of Los Angeles over 75 years ago.</p>

  <p>Gladys Kern's final resting place is at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale. But her tragic fate has left a lasting impact on her family. Her son Jack, passed away in 1962 and her husband John, followed a decade later in 1972. Her daughter, Peggy Ann, lived a long life, but undoubtedly carried the weight of her mother's unsolved murder. Peggy Ann passed away in 2009, never having seen justice served for her mother's death.</p>
