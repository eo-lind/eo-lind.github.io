  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> While we have decided to try and stick with unsolved cases as far as true crime goes, this one has been solved. I originally researched and wrote this episode and its conclusion almost three years ago, and I felt that since the story is so intricate and the work was already done, we could make an exception here and share it anyway.</p>

  <p>In 1992 in a small town outside of Memphis, a 65-year-old woman went missing from her home. Her distraught family and the local media received a bizarre chain of ransom demands, and were prepared to pay, but were always left holding the bag.</p><p>The investigation twisted and turned, but ended up closer to home than anyone could have imagined.</p>

  <p>In this episode and the next, I'm going to tell you a story you may have heard in brief before, because it was covered many, many years ago on Unsolved Mysteries. It was just done as a short special alert, and it has a little text update on the resolution in the version of the old show that you can find on whatever streaming service now. But I've got a whole lot more information for you.</p>

  <p class="marker">[BUMPER]</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Martha Eudora Jones was born in Gibson County, Tennessee, on October 12th, 1926. But her nickname was "Doe," so that's what I'm going to call her throughout this episode. We couldn't find any information on how Doe met him, but she married a man named Alan Crawford Roberts in Olive Branch, Mississippi, in 1948.</p>
  
  <p>Early on, she worked at a cafeteria in Memphis, and Alan installed insulation and weather stripping. So these were just regular people. In the '50s, Doe and Alan bought a Memphis restaurant called Magnolia Grill, but in 1961, they got out of that venture and opened Holiday Auto Parts. I don't know what became of the business after the events of this story, but at the time of one of the 1993 articles I read, there were six Holiday Auto Parts stores, so it sounds like the Robertses were really successful.</p>
  
  <p>There's a weird aside here that I don't want to skip mentioning. I don't know that this case is known outside of Tennessee, but those of us from the state have all heard of Philip Workman. He was convicted for the 1981 murder of a Memphis police officer after he robbed a Wendy's. When researching this case, I googled Holiday Auto Parts and learned that the shooting that Workman was convicted of actually occurred in the parking lot of one of their stores, which was next to that Wendy's.</p>
  
  <p>Workman was executed in 2007.</p>
  
  <p>One of the best anecdotes we read about Alan and Doe was that they got really into square dancing in the late '50s. Not only that, but Alan eventually became a professional square dance caller. Friends and family said Doe and Alan were generous. They didn't have any kids, but they were really close to their nieces and nephews.</p>
  
  <p>We don't know exactly when they moved there, but at the time our story begins, 1992, Doe and Alan lived on a 150 acre farm near Eads, Tennessee, a town of 800 people about 25 miles east of Memphis. Every location we mention tonight is near Memphis.</p>
  
  <p>On August 7th, 1992, Alan headed out around 9:30 a.m. to conduct some business. He was developing a subdivision in neighboring Fayette County, and he'd received a call from a man the previous day who wanted to see one of the homes.</p>
  
  <p>So on the 7th, Alan was going to the property to meet the man, who said his name was Sam Wagner and that he was from Indiana, but Wagner never showed. Eventually, Alan returned home, finding the garage door open, though his wife's car and bicycle were still inside. However, 65-year-old Doe was nowhere to be seen.</p>
  
  <p>She'd just had cataract surgery on both eyes, so she couldn't drive anywhere. And what's more, her inhaler was still in the house. This was significant because her asthma was serious enough that her life could be in danger if she didn't keep it with her.</p>
  
  <p>Seeing the inhaler is what really alarmed Alan. He called around to friends and neighbors to ask if anyone had seen her, but no one had. What happened to Doe, at least to some degree, wouldn't remain a mystery for long, though.</p>
  
  <p>That evening, Alan got a call from a man who was using an obviously fake Asian accent, demanding a $100,000 ransom and threatening to quote, "split her head open" if it wasn't paid. Alan said the man also instructed him to smash his answering machine in the driveway. Presumably this means that part of the call was caught on the machine, but it wasn't made clear in the materials we read.</p>
  
  <p>Incredibly, the guy then hung up before actually giving Alan any instructions on how to get the money to him. Alan contacted authorities right away. And the investigation of Doe's disappearance was put into the hands of the Shelby County Sheriff's Office and the FBI.</p>
  
  <p>Alan made public pleas to get his wife back and offered up $10,000 for information and Doe's safe return. Here he is in a news clip that was re-aired on Unsolved Mysteries:</p>
  
  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Alan Roberts:</cite> If Doe is released unharmed, I will meet any demand. I will do whatever is necessary to obtain her release.</p>
  
  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> He added that since the couple had no children, Doe was his life. Here he is in a later update episode of Unsolved Mysteries:</p>
  
  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Alan Roberts:</cite> I love my wife. We were like one. We'd been together for 44 years, and we was planning on another 44 years.</p>
  
  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> One friend who had seen Doe a few days before her disappearance said she seemed fine. Another friend who saw her on August 3rd told the Commercial Appeal, quote, "She mentioned fears she had of people, not serious, some business things." We found no further information on that conversation, but please file that quote away to compare with what actually happened.</p>
  
  <p>The idea of Doe leaving on her own also wasn't really a consideration. Family members told the press that it just wasn't the kind of thing she would do. Also, as I mentioned before, she was temporarily unable to drive at this time.</p>
  
  <p>There isn't a lot of information available on what went on over the course of the year following her disappearance, really just snippets.</p>
  
  <p>The episode of Unsolved Mysteries that carried the story of her disappearance aired on September 23rd, about a month and a half after the incident. It was just a special alert, so it wasn't a long segment. Alan received a second ransom call in October 1992. Authorities were able to trace that one, and it led them to a payphone in Bartlett, Tennessee, a town about halfway between Eads and downtown Memphis. But that was about the extent of it.</p>
  
  <p>Between the first call on the day of Doe's disappearance in June 1993, her friends and family received dozens of calls from this man, typically demanding money in exchange for information. Among the friends and family other than Alan who got calls, many of them went directly to the FBI with the information. Authorities told those people not to say anything about it, meaning that they didn't go to Alan with information about the calls. When he found out later, he was hurt, which is understandable. </p>
  
  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Alan Roberts:</cite> Any implications that I was involved in the kidnapping of my wife is totally untrue. And I resent it.</p>
  
  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> As a result of the many calls, Unsolved Mysteries aired an update with that information on their February 2nd 1993 episode. In fact, you can hear a very short clip of the caller because they play one in that episode.</p>
  
  <p>According to the Unsolved Mysteries Wiki entry on the case, the caller contacted a local TV station in March 1993 claiming Doe was dead, but he wouldn't give any other information and hung up. The news anchor who spoke with him recorded the call and they wound up airing it on the news.</p>
  
  <p>He called the station again the next day, this time claiming she was actually alive and demanding $80,000.</p>
  
  <p>According to the FBI Files episode on the case, he was very angry that the recording had been made and shared. But somehow the anchor was able to arrange a ransom drop.</p>
  
  <p>Authorities staked out the drop at a local mall, where a reporter arrived with the $80,000. Unfortunately, the caller was a no-show. This leads us to Alan. Authorities were looking at him as a primary suspect in Doe's disappearance. Obviously, the spouse is always the first place they look.</p>
  
  <p>But also, the guy who was making the ransom calls would sometimes tell people that this was all happening because Alan had offered to pay to have his wife kidnapped, but then backed out of the deal. Alan, of course, denied involvement, telling the Commercial Appeal he was, quote, "growing weary of the crap."</p>
  
  <p>For what it's worth, Doe's family also didn't believe he was involved and they were upset that he was even being looked at as a suspect.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, Alan and the family also believed Doe was dead and probably had died very soon after her disappearance, possibly as a result of her asthma attacks and not having her medication. But authorities continued to investigate Alan, even at one point digging up a small dump on the Roberts property looking for her body.</p>
  
  <p>Within the first year after her disappearance, Alan took two polygraphs, which he told reporters that he'd passed. He said he was asked if he killed Doe, and he answered that he hadn't. He also said he gave consent for the FBI to search his home, which they did two months after Doe disappeared. It sounds like they didn't find anything.</p>
  
  <p>It seems crazy that they waited two whole months to search the property, but no explanation for that was given as far as we could find. In any case, Roberts said he had nothing to hide.</p>

  <p class="marker">[AD BREAK]</p>

  <p class="marker">[BUMPER]</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> In August 1993, Doe's nephew, William Paul Knox, told reporters that he and his brother got a call in early June of that year, demanding a ransom of $85,000. They were given a drop location and told to wait for instructions.</p>
  
  <p>But, according to the Commercial Appeal, no one ever showed up. I'm going to circle back to this story in a minute. So, keep it in mind.</p>
  
  <p>On August 4th, 1993, almost a year after Doe's disappearance, the FBI announced that they knew who was making the calls and that, quote, "He knows that we know." The agent declined to name the person but said he was a man who knew the Robertses and that there was a good chance that the disappearance and the calls could be unrelated as if they were hoax calls.</p>
  
  <p>Obviously, they still hadn't located Doe, and this was the first time the authorities publicly called the case a probable homicide.</p>
  
  <p>Less than a week later, it was reported that the FBI and Shelby County Sheriff's Office dragged three ponds looking for Doe's remains. One of the ponds was on or near the property of a man named Charles Jackson Lord Jr. Now at this point in time, nothing was really reported on who Lord was. But, we will get to that soon.</p>
  
  <p>According to the Commercial Appeal, Lord offered to act as an intermediary with the kidnappers after a local TV station got one of those mysterious phone calls from the man who wanted money for information on Doe. Obviously that's weird and it set off alarm bells.</p>
  
  <p>In the midst of all of this, a private tribute service for Doe was held at Eads United Methodist, marking the year since her disappearance. 85 people attended and Alan led the service with a prayer and memories of his wife, telling attendees, quote, "She's not with me physically, but she is spiritually. Someday I will join her."</p>
  
  <p>A couple of weeks passed, but there was big news on August 26th. Officials announced the arrest of Charles Lord, naming him a suspect in Doe's disappearance. Shelby County Sheriff A.C. Gillis told the press that they had a confession and believed Doe to be dead.</p>
  
  <p>Lord was a 59-year-old retired Defense Depot comptroller who was actually a friend of Doe and Alan. Lord attended the same church, Eads United Methodist, and they lived about three miles apart, which, in a rural community, would make them neighbors.</p>
  
  <p>It didn't sound like the Roberts and Lord families were super close, but they were definitely friends. The Commercial Appeal mentioned that, in addition to doing church work together, they'd had dinner with each other about four times over the course of six to eight years. Also, sometime either a couple of months or a couple of years before Doe's disappearance, depending on which article you read, Lord told Alan he was looking for investors because he wanted to get involved in a beer distributorship in Mexico. Alan said it sounded too good to be true. Ultimately he passed on the opportunity.</p>
  
  <p>In the weeks leading up to Lord's arrest, the FBI had been poking around in his financial affairs after they'd noticed he'd filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy the previous month. He owed a significant amount of money to 10 different creditors, and later it was revealed that they uncovered evidence of different financial crimes Lord committed between 1985 and 1992.</p>
  
  <p>Among those crimes were fraudulent loans, embezzlement from the federal government through his job, and perhaps most telling, embezzlement from his church. While serving as the chairman of the church's board of trustees, Lord stole $70,000 from Eads United Methodist.</p>
  
  <p>The idea was that Lord stole from the church to pay back some of this huge, sketchy loan he got from the Defense Depot credit union before he retired. Neighbors expressed shock in the press at Lord's alleged involvement. They thought he was a good guy, and some even cited the fact that he was active in his church, which means nothing. Look at BTK.</p>
  
  <p>Alan, on the other hand, wasn't surprised when Lord was arrested. He told the Commercial Appeal, quote, "Charles Lord is the only neighbor of mine who acted in a manner that wasn't normal like to me. He did and said things that were inconsistent with normal thinking."</p>
  
  <p>Alan revealed to the press that in November or December of 1992, Lord asked him to meet up. They drove to nearby Bartlett, Tennessee and talked in Lord's truck in a parking lot. Lord offered to act as an intermediary with the kidnappers, requesting $25,000 from Alan to bribe, quote, "some underworld character" for information on Doe. Alan told the Commercial Appeal, quote, "I felt like Charles was enjoying playing FBI. It was real secretive."</p>
  
  <p>Lord told Alan that he had a Secret Service connection and that this connection was in touch with quote, "underworld characters" who they could pay for information. </p>
  
  <p>Sometime in early 1993, Lord came to Alan again, this time offering $10,000 of his own money for the scheme. Alan told Lord he would reimburse that money and also give him the reward, but only if they were able to actually get information.</p>
  
  <p>The Commercial Appeal noted that Mike Coward, another member of Eads United Methodist, was present for this conversation. Coward told the paper, quote, "Charles offered the $10,000 in snitch money, but it never materialized. I never doubted anything he said."</p>
  
  <p>Coward also said that Lord, quote, "admonished Alan to watch his behavior," but wouldn't elaborate for reporters on what that meant. Unfortunately, we have absolutely no follow up on that comment, but it was weird enough that we wanted to include it.</p>
  
  <p>Alan told reporters that he promised Lord he wouldn't go to the police, but he wound up telling the FBI all about it when it was clear that they were pursuing him - Alan, that is - as a suspect.</p>
  
  <p>At some point, Lord also started telling Doe's family and friends that he thought Alan had something to do with the disappearance. Apparently, Alan heard about it somewhere, so obviously they didn't really talk after that.</p>
  
  <p>A little while ago, I mentioned Doe's nephews getting a call about ransom. There was a slightly different version of that story in the Unsolved Mysteries Wiki about the case, and yet another in the episode of the FBI Files that covered the case. I tend to trust what I read in the Commercial Appeal more, but that story was published before they arrested Lord, so it could just be that the nephew couldn't give all of this information to the public at that time. In any case, we want to include both versions of the incident, regardless of the details, because it is what caused the investigators to zero in on Lord.</p>
  
  <p>The Unsolved Mysteries Wiki says that two of Doe's nephews suspected Lord, so they gave him their unlisted phone number, which no one else had. Evidently, they got a ransom call at that number the very next night. It's such a simple but clever trick.</p>
  
  <p>Now think back to what I said earlier about how the nephew said the kidnapper never showed up to get the money when they went where they were told. According to the case entry on this website, later that night Lord showed up. He said he wanted to act as an intermediary and get the money to the kidnapper, but apparently he messed up and gave a detail that only the kidnapper would have known. Something about expecting their mother to be there, which we didn't really understand from the information provided. This is when they got into some sort of verbal altercation with Lord, and he took off. The nephews called the FBI right away.</p>
  
  <p>The version of this story told on the FBI Files said that the nephews got a ransom call and that they were instructed to bring the money to a local motel, which they did with surveillance from the FBI. Lord showed up at the motel and said he'd been contacted by the kidnapper who told him to go to the motel and collect the money.</p>
  
  <p>Lord claimed that the kidnapper said he would be called with further instructions on where to take it. The nephews refused to give him the money, of course, and said they wanted to give it to the kidnapper themselves.</p>
  
  <p>For the most part, this is the same as what the Unsolved Mysteries Wiki entries said, but with more detail. The show went on to say that this circumstantial evidence didn't give authorities enough to arrest Lord, so they had to keep investigating him.</p>
  
  <p>His bankruptcy filing came very shortly after this incident, so they started looking into his finances for a motive. Eventually, this trail led them to get a search warrant for his home, which turned up evidence of embezzlement. Still, there wasn't enough to charge him with the kidnapping, so they knew they were going to have to angle for a confession.</p>
  
  <p>It sounds like Lord first inserted himself into the case by offering to help Alan earlier in the year, and Alan put the FBI onto him, but maybe they weren't ready to consider Lord seriously yet. But then, Lord did the same thing again in June with the nephews, and this time he really made himself look guilty, and it was enough to shift the focus of the investigation onto him. We don't know that for a fact, but it makes sense.</p>
  
  <p>We have quite a bit more to cover in this case. But this is where we're going to leave it for this episode.</p>
