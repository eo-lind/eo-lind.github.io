  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> You're gonna enjoy this. Because you're kind of a car person, right?</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Okay.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Yeah, I probably mentioned this somewhere in the story. I wrote it like a year ago… actually more than that. I think I wrote this before I left Nashville, but, just for our listeners, I don't know anything about cars. So nobody come at me if I say something stupid.</p>

  <p>Most of the bones of the story I'm going to tell here come from some really good reporting in these two articles by a guy named Mike Spinelli on the website Jalopnik. I guess it's a car website. So as far as sourcing here, you can go ahead and assume that's where I learned anything I tell you, unless I note otherwise. But as usual, there will be links to those articles and any other sources in the notes. Well, not in the notes on the app, but our show notes, and our show notes link is in the app.</p>

  <p>So, back in the late 70s, there was a buzz in the newspapers about a weird Ferrari story. And this tale involved a wealthy widow in Beverly Hills.</p>

  <p>So this widow, her name was Sandra Eileen West, and she passed away after an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. It's very sad, but before her death, she made a unique request. She wanted her body and her beloved 1964 Ferrari 330 America to be transported to San Antonio, Texas, where she would be laid to rest next to her late husband, of course, an oil man.</p>

  <p>This sounds very, very Texas so far, but here comes the really quirky part.</p>

  <p>So, West's body was placed in the driver's seat of the car, and the vehicle was then lowered into the burial plot. To ensure that the car wouldn't be stolen, they actually filled the burial plot with a significant amount of cement. That's kind of all there is to her story, and that's actually not the story I'm here to tell.</p>

  <p>It's a wild one, but instead we're going to be exploring another Ferrari tale that is different from West's, but has sort of a crucial similarity.</p>

  <p>I wrote here - I can't believe I wrote this in my script. I wrote, “I'm no gearhead." What?</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> It is a word people use to like refer to people who are super into like cars, but I think specifically like the the parts of cars and engines and all that shit, like that are super into working on cars, and usually it's like fast cars. That's what I associate it with anyway.</p>

  <p>Well, I don't know what the Olivia of two years ago who wrote this was thinking. The point is - to sound more like myself here - I'm not like a big car enthusiast as I mentioned at the top, so I'm going to do my best to give the details here on the car we're talking about, but I'm going to be saying some things, and I have no idea what they mean.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Okay.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> So meet the star of our show, a dark green Ferrari Dino 2-4-6 GTS. Maybe it's a 246. I don't know. I'm no gearhead.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> I'm gonna get you a shirt that says that.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> I'll make one!</p>

  <p>So to my untrained eye, it looks like any other fancy sports car, but apparently it's got some noteworthy modifications. First up, it's got Campagnolo wheels. I'm also no Italian, so hopefully I got that right. But I'm told those were kind of a big deal in the world of lightweight car parts.</p>

  <p>It's also got some swanky seats from the Daytona model. Again, no idea what that means, but it might mean something to someone. So what's a Ferrari without a little luxury? So you want to modify it, I guess.</p>

  <p>This Dino's early days were nothing out of the ordinary. It was just another shiny sports car. It made its way from the Bay area, from some showroom to a Hollywood sports car dealership in 1974. And that October, a plumber named Rosendo Cruz bought the car as a birthday present for his wife. So he must have been doing a lot of plumbing, right?</p>

  <p>This was a $22,500 car - a gift. And I guess as of the last time I checked on inflation and what that price would be, it was back in April of 2023. At that time, that would amount to $133,000 today. So, yeah. A plumber, right?</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Are we sure that's all this guy's doing?</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> I mean, everything is more expensive here. So maybe the plumbers are really making money. Maybe that's why my landlord never, you know, responds to any maintenance requests. Maybe all the maintenance people are just charging big Ferrari money.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Are we sure that this isn't like a front? like a organized crime thing where you have a business to like-</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Launder money? Maybe so.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> That's just a lot. I mean not that plumbers probably do make good money - and they should, for what they have to deal with.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Right, right.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> But that's a really expensive car.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Definitely. Well, as fate would have it, this wasn't gonna be a long lasting love story for Mrs. Cruz and her car anyway. On the day of their anniversary, these two folks, the Cruzes, found themselves with a missing Dino instead of a romantic night out.</p>

  <p>So, on December 7th, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz went out for an anniversary dinner at the legendary Brown Derby,  and not trusting the valet with the pricey sports car  - long before Ferris Bueller ever came around - Rosendo opted to park the car himself.</p>

  <p>So he left the Dino out on Wilshire Boulevard. And evidently thieves, maybe car enthusiasts with a taste for, I don't know, luxury, made away with the Dino.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> What year did you say it was? Sorry. I'm looking up a picture.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> 1974.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Oh this is a really cool car.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> It is, it is.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Oh, yeah, this is a cool fucking car.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Yeah, I don't think I'd steal one, but I'd love to go for a ride.</p>

  <p>Evidently thieves, maybe some car enthusiast thieves made away with the Dino, leaving the Cruz family without a ride home and leaving Farmers Insurance with a hefty bill to pay. And like any insurance company, they paid up without a fuss. What? No. That's not most people's experience with insurance, right?</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> With any insurance.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> They were just like, “Yeah, no, okay, I'm sorry your car got stolen. Here's a bunch of money.” But wait! There's more! This was not the end of the Dino's wild ride.</p>

  <p>So now we're gonna fast forward a few years to February, 1978.</p>

  <p>Back then, kids didn't have a bunch of screens to stare at, so they usually did exciting things to pass the time, like, I don't know, digging in the dirt? I'm being sarcastic, but actually, you know, digging in the dirt can be fun. I did it.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Yeah! Me too.</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> But probably extra fun if you were kids digging in the front yard of a house in the West Adams part of L.A. that day when they hit something with a clang. And it looked suspiciously like they were unearthing a whole ass car. Yeah. In the front yard. Apparently, there was a Sheriff's deputy in the area for whatever reason, and they got his attention, and this wound up being the start of an investigation.</p>

  <p class="marker"></p>[RECORD SCRATCH SOUND EFFECT]</p>

  <cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Wait, wait. That's how it was reported at the time. And it makes a good story, but that's not actually how authorities found the car.</p>

  <p>Based on a bit of investigation, Jalopnik founder Mike Spinelli, who I mentioned at the beginning, reported that the sheriff's department was actually tipped off by an informant.</p>

  <p>So, I don't, so maybe some kids didn't find it, but I like that story better. In any case, it's not every day that you dig up a Ferrari in a front yard. So that did happen. It was buried in a front yard. I just- it probably wasn't kids playing in the dirt.</p>

  <p>So the informant alleged that the car's owner, Mr. Cruz, had some guys steal the car at the Brown Derby. Maybe he was regretting that big purchase. And the thieves were supposed to chop up the car for parts and dump whatever was left. However, it seemed like the thieves were maybe a little too enamored with the car and didn't want to cut it up, dismember it, and maybe buried it in the hope that they could safely dig it up one day at some later date, and I don't know, drive it, sell it, whatever. But for whatever reason, They did not come back for it.</p>
