  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> This is part two of a two part series.</p>
  <p>In 1992, in a small town outside of Memphis, 65-year-old Doe Roberts went missing from her home. Her distraught family and the local media received a bizarre chain of ransom demands and were prepared to pay but were always left holding the bag. The investigation twisted and turned, but ended up closer to home than anyone could have imagined.</p>

  <p>In our last episode, we went over the disappearance of Doe Roberts, the ransom calls that came in for months after, and we left off with the arrest of Charles J. Lord, a friend and neighbor of Doe and Alan. That's where we'll pick up today. </p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Authorities conducted three interviews with Lord in late August and early September of that year, all of which were recorded. Lord agreed to the interviews after he was given assurances that they wouldn't seek the death penalty.</p>

  <p>They employed techniques suggested by an FBI profiler and the pressure of a polygraph in order to get him to talk. Ultimately, the tactics were successful, but Lord gave a different account of what happened in each of those interviews, so it took time to get to the truth. So, now we're going to go through the gist of each of those as it was laid out in court records.</p>

  <p>In the first interview, on August 26th, Lord admitted that he'd called the Roberts home and pretended he was interested in buying the property within the Fayette County subdivision. He said he'd done it in order to get Alan out of the house. After Alan left, Lord said he went to the Roberts home and told Doe that Alan had been in a serious accident.</p>

  <p>She left with Lord in his truck, believing she was being taken to see Alan. It probably would have been easy to get her to hop in his truck, since she still couldn't drive because of her cataract surgery.</p>

  <p>Lord told investigators that Doe got really upset and collapsed. This wasn't really explained in the court documents so it's not clear if he was saying she was upset about this supposed accident her husband had been in or if she realized she was being kidnapped and got upset.</p>

  <p>In any case, he said he then checked on her and seeing that she wasn't breathing, he freaked out, drove to the middle of a bridge, and threw Doe into the Wolf River, a tributary of the Mississippi that runs south of Eads. Lord admitted that the purpose of getting Alan out of the house and kidnapping Doe was to collect a ransom.</p>

  <p>Further, he said he had the idea three or four months before the kidnapping actually happened, so this was looking very premeditated. Lord also admitted to making the multiple ransom calls related to the kidnapping that people kept getting.</p>

  <p>This interview led authorities to do extensive searches of the river. On the first day of the search, Lord took them out there to show them where he said he threw her body off the Alex Spiller Bridge on Chulahoma Road. Over the course of three days, dive teams searched the Wolf River in the area of the bridge, But they found nothing related to Doe.</p>

  <p>They did turn up a few unrelated things that I wanted to mention just because I thought it was interesting. The first was a $20 bill. They also found a few bones, which obviously piqued their interest, but they turned out to be animal bones. They spotted a motorcycle, but didn't remove it. But the most intriguing thing they found was a small safe. According to the FBI Files, they found that the safe came from a robbery at a dry cleaners. And they found money that had fallen out of it. The paper reported the $20 bill looked like it was something separate, but maybe that's where it came from.</p>

  <p>As far as the prospects for finding Doe's remains in the river, the expectation was that they would be skeletal, since she would have been in there just over a year. Going in, they knew finding her would be difficult, both because the water was murky, But also because it would be really easy for bones to wind up scattered way downstream.</p>

  <p>After turning up no evidence in the river, authorities decided to administer a lie detector test centered around the location of Doe's body. It was somewhere in this process, according to what we read in court records, that Lord wound up telling them that Doe was buried in his yard.</p>

  <p>On August 30th, Doe's nude body was found buried in a shallow pit in Lord's backyard behind a pile of compost.</p>

  <p>An investigator interviewed on the FBI Files mentioned that her skin was intact and the body was in good condition, with lime and concrete actually preserving the remains instead of destroying them.</p>

  <p>She was found lying on her back, but one notable thing the show pointed out was that her hand was in front of her face and what the investigator described as quote, "a defensive position" with the fingers spread. Both the narrator and investigator went on to say that this suggested that Doe might not have even been dead when she was buried. I hadn't read or heard that elsewhere, so it was pretty shocking.</p>

  <p>Her remains were eventually taken away and scheduled for an autopsy, and she was officially identified on September 1st. Lord's second interview also took place on September 1st.</p>

  <p>This time around, Lord claimed Doe and Alan were having relationship problems and that he, Lord, and Doe got involved with each other. He told authorities that the reason he lured Alan out of the house with the fake property business was so that he could get together with Doe and talk to her about her marital problems. He went on to say that when he got to her house, they had sex.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the course of this visit, Lord said something to Doe about how he needed money. According to Lord, this got Doe really mad. Thinking he was just acting like he was into her to butter her up and get money. Lord claimed that he didn't even know what happened, but that he quote, "smothered her with a pillow for a brief time."</p>

  <p>This is when he freaked out. Presumably the point he's trying to make is that he realized she was dead, but he hadn't intended to kill her.</p>

  <p>He put Doe in his truck with the idea of disposing of her in the river. But then he thought someone might see him, so he took her body back to his house. The Commercial Appeal described his property as being surrounded by trees and lily ponds with a latticework fence. It was situated on a dead end road.</p>

  <p>Okay, so now we have to pause to learn a gardening term because it's relevant. I'm going to oversimplify this, but there is a gardening technique called double digging, where basically you dig a trench, then you do some other stuff to it that includes introducing richer matter like compost. Again, oversimplifying.</p>

  <p>The next step is to dig another trench behind it. The soil from that second trench is used to backfill the first. Then you would go on to do one after that and so on. It's done in order to give a bed better drainage and aeration so the soil is more suitable for planting.</p>

  <p>So this is how Lord explained away the pre-dug hole. His contention was that he just remembered that he already had a hole dug because he used this double digging process, so he repurposed it as a shallow grave.</p>

  <p>Now, back to the interview. Lord said he remembered the trench, put Doe's body in there, poured two bags of lime on her, and then covered her with dirt. He also poured sacks of concrete in, but it sounds like it wasn't mixed. Then at some point later on, he turned the soil and also covered the spot with leaves.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Now we move to the next day, when the third interview was conducted.</p>

  <p>This time around, Lord told investigators that much of the information he gave in his first two interviews wasn't true, and he expressed a desire to tell the truth. This time, he admitted that he was having serious money trouble, and his plan was to kidnap Doe so he could collect a ransom. That was really already established, so that was the consistent part of all three interviews.</p>

  <p>But, in this interview, Lord said he wasn't sure that he'd need to kill her, but that he did indeed dig the hole in his yard for the purpose of burying her. So, when he mentioned double digging in the previous interview, it was just a handy excuse to make the murder look like it wasn't premeditated.</p>

  <p>Let's interrupt the narrative here for a minute. If he'd been cultivating this idea for three or four months before the crime, he had a lot of time to think through possible complications. Had he been a stranger to the Roberts family, you could buy the idea that he wasn't necessarily planning to kill Doe. But if he kidnapped her, got the ransom, and let her go, she'd be able to ID him. There is no way that didn't occur to him over all that time he spent planning. If you look at it in that light, It seems he intended to kill her all along.</p>

  <p>Returning to the interview, Lord told investigators that what he'd said in the first interview about luring Alan away by pretending to be someone looking to purchase the land did happen. As did the part about Martha getting in his truck. But then he added a lot of new elements and details.</p>

  <p>Lord had an apartment in or over the garage at his home, and that's where he took Doe after she got in the truck with him. He already had strips of rags and a belt waiting, and he used those to tie her to a chair. Next, he put duct tape over her eyes. I'm not sure what the purpose of that was since she'd already seen him, but it sounds especially cruel.</p>

  <p>After covering her eyes, he forced her to take sleeping pills and pain pills. Once the pills were in her system, Lord took Doe's clothes off and put her on a bed. She was apparently still bound in some way. At this point, he cut buttons, snaps, and other parts off of her clothes. Things that couldn't be burned. And then he burned her clothes. The stuff he cut off was going to be thrown out elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Lord called Alan that afternoon with the $100,000 ransom demand, after which, he returned to the garage apartment and tied Doe to the chair again.</p>

  <p>Lord's wife called around this time and told him Alan had called her and asked if she'd seen Doe, which she hadn't. She had no idea what was going on in that garage apartment. Somewhere in all of this - this part of the timeline wasn't clear from the court records we saw - Lord wound up back at his house, but he returned to the garage after his wife went to sleep.</p>

  <p>It was at this point that Lord put Doe, who was still pretty out of it from the pills, back on the bed. This is when he raped her. The documentation we read wasn't clear if this was his wording or the court's, but it said, quote, "had sexual intercourse." So, it's unclear if he was claiming this was consensual or not, but obviously it's 100 percent sexual assault, no matter how he characterized it.</p>

  <p>Lord told investigators that he hadn't counted on Doe's remains being in the condition that they found them. That is to say, they were in better shape than he'd planned. So now he knew that they could probably tell the story of what happened. He admitted to drugging her, the sexual assault (that's my wording, not his), and smothering her, because he figured the autopsy would reveal all of that anyway.</p>

  <p>Between the confession and recovery of Doe's body, this pretty much brought the investigation to a close. So now it was time to seek some sort of justice.</p>

  <p>Investigators and the prosecution felt like the disclosures Lord made in the third interview made the most sense and were the most truthful. And so it was that information that they used to officially lay out the facts of the case in court.</p>

  <p>And to be clear, this wasn't a trial. It was a plea hearing, which took place on October 19th, 1993. There would be no trial, as Lord entered a guilty plea that day.</p>

  <p>Charles Lord was convicted in Fayette County Circuit Court of first degree murder and aggravated rape. He was sentenced to life plus 20 years to be served consecutively.</p>

  <p>Doe is buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis. She was laid to rest 13 months after her disappearance, just after what would have been her 66th birthday.</p>

  <p>Alan went on to remarry, and along with his second wife, Esther, and local attorney and author, D. Beecher Smith II, he wrote a book about the ordeal called Fatal Friendship: The Search for Doe Roberts.</p>

  <p>As a side note, it appears that attorney, unless there's another Memphis lawyer with the same name, ran into some disturbing trouble shortly after. We're not going to go into it because it's totally unrelated, but I mention it because I know somebody is going to email us if I don't.</p>

  <p>Alan, who was well loved and known to many as Uncle Alan, died at age 78 in 2005. Charles Lord died in prison in 2016.</p>
