  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Where to start? So it's been a few years since we released podcast episodes. The pandemic started and I kind of burned out, and I've found out since then it was probably ADHD-</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Oh yeah.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> -that was causing that for me and I'm struggling with it worse than ever, but I'm on medication and trying to get that figured out. So here we are, but also, we're in two different locations, so all of our recordings now are remote. Which we've done some of those before, but now it's out of necessity because I'm in L.A., and so you can't just come right over to record. Unfortunately.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> That's true.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> But if I talk you into moving here, that could be different.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Maybe if someone wants to pay for it.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah, pay for it, give you a good job. Give me a good job too, maybe.</p>

  <p>But okay. So one of the main things I wanted to address was true crime, which is what we have done for the majority of our episodes in the past. When we first started thinking about starting up the show again, I was like, "Okay, well we'll do some true crime episodes and some just like weird, crazy stuff episodes." I have had a change in the way I look at the genre. I think it's easy for anybody to see how much exploitation is out there now in, podcasting, on TV - I think it's worse on TV. But with true crime podcasts, back when we got started, it was a level playing field and it really isn't anymore. Big companies with a lot of money saw that they could make a lot of money with fairly low investment on the front end and took it over.</p>

  <p>I don't know, a lot of the landscape out there is pretty gross.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I mean, you're a lot more familiar with that stuff than me. I listen to like five podcasts regularly and none of them are true crime.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Well, and I listen just excessively. And again, I think some of that is the ADHD because I like having a media I can consume while I'm able to do something else at the same time. So listening is part of it. I think, I don't, I don't know how much people on the just listening end of it are aware of the exploitation and the conversations that are happening, thank God, around ethics in true crime. I see a lot of it because I'm in, you know, like Facebook groups related to it, but I don't know how it is with the casual listener. If you're listening to true crime podcasts, or consuming a lot of true crime media, it's probably something worth looking into.</p>

  <p>Not you specifically, but just people out there.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> No, I know enough from bits and pieces that you'll tell me or I'll see you post that I'm like yeah. I mean, a lot of it doesn't surprise me because of human beings, the nature of how they are sometimes. And also just the way that media and entertainment in general has sort of went over the last few years and the shift that's happened. And it's one of those things - because it's the same thing with everything else - same thing with movies. It's more accessible than ever for people to create things and put them out there, whether it's to make a movie or a podcast or whatever, but the problem with that is everyone can make stuff.</p>

  <p>I don't ever want to feel like snobby or gatekeeper-y about that but at the same time, it produces this like, mountain of stuff to sort through, and the truth is, like you said earlier it's not a level playing field. You have people that are going to put a bunch of money behind something, and either they're finding people who have a reputation in some other regard, whether they're already famous, or they're a journalist, or, you know, or even just a famous person, like a celebrity.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Right.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Or it's people that, I can only imagine based on things you've told me, that for years did work really hard. They strike some sort of deal and then they get really screwed.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah. I've seen that happen, too.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> 'Cause it happens all the time with, with people who I mean, I don't know. There's a part of me that feels- I don't feel weird saying like art - but at the same time there's work that goes into it, and I think that usually at least the best podcasts I've listened to have at least some level of creativity.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> And like critical thinking!</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Well, and there's, you know, I don't want to crap on our own show, but I've listened to a lot of things and I do really enjoy investigative podcasts, but sometimes I don't think my writing is that great and I can only do so much as far as the research. So, sometimes the content of our show is maybe like not top notch, but I think... What I've gathered just from comments from people and that sort thing is, I think that our regular listeners, a lot of it is they listen and, and we feel like friends and they like our personality and our interaction. And that's, that's awesome to me. As long as you're getting something out of it, that's great.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Sure.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> And I have some podcasts like that where, I don't know, they're not super serious and investigative or really breaking new ground, but maybe they're hosts that I really like and connect with. So I like that. And hopefully with true crime kind of moving out of the way, those people will still stick with us, you know, especially if we're talking about-</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I think they will.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> -weird stuff, but because basically when I thought about starting the show back up...</p>

  <p>Originally, my idea was to still do some true crime episodes and just do those as a solo host, because I was always like very defensive of chatty true crime podcasts. And I still think you and I we only had fun at the expense of perpetrators and that sort of thing and I still think our intentions were totally good. But especially in listening more to, like, families of victims and survivors who've had these stories told on some of these podcasts, if somebody just sends a family member a link to one of our episodes or if they just stumble on it, they don't know us. They don't know, you know, they haven't listened to us. They don't know that our intentions are good and maybe they don't want to hear us being unserious talking about, like, the worst thing that ever happened in their lives.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> No, I think that's really fair. You know.</p>

  <p>I think we definitely had some episodes, and when I think back on it, the episodes that I enjoyed that we did the most were either ones that were very serious throughout the whole thing, or ones that, and I think this is sort of what you were talking about and you would agree the stuff that wasn't as serious because it usually wasn't about some horrific crime.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah. Like, paranormal stuff. Whatever. We actually kind of got started on this about bringing the show back almost a year ago and I started writing some stuff then and then stopped and didn't finish, And again: ADHD.</p>

  <p>So I wrote some episodes back then and, basically, now I'm at the point where I just don't, well, I should say... So those episodes I was gonna record as a solo narrator. Well, sometime between then and now, I decided I don't want to do any more true crime episodes. I just don't.</p>

  <p>So, you know, I think we're going to phase that out. That being said, I did record those because I worked really hard on them, and somewhere along the way, before I decided not to do them anymore at all, I decided, okay, I'm only gonna do unsolved because there's not really anything to gain.</p>

  <p>You can't do anything helpful for anybody if a case has already been solved, unless maybe someone's been wrongfully convicted. At that point it feels just gratuitous.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Sure.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> But I had written at least one solved one before I made that decision. I did the work. I put a lot of effort into it. So I've decided to record 'em and release 'em anyway.</p>

  <p>But one thing I've learned in editing it is that I suck as a solo narrator.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I don't think that's true.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I think that people are gonna find it boring. And so for our regular listeners, I understand if you do. Stick with us, but there are only going to be a few of those. All of our old episodes are getting moved to Patreon and those will all be there.</p>

  <p>I'm thinking about maybe getting summaries of the unsolved ones - I was gonna re-record them and I've decided of course not to do that - but get summaries of the unsolved ones up on the website because I don't like the idea of taking an unsolved case and then just putting it behind a paywall because, you know, what if somebody out there stumbles on it and has some information that can help?</p>

  <p>So that's still kind of up in the air. But just as far as those episodes, thank you in advance, people, for your patience. I don't know, I do not look at our ratings anymore and reviews because I just, I have thin skin and I don't need people fussing about my voice or us cussing or whatever. But it is still really important to rate and review podcasts.</p>

  <p>It always made me so happy to see a good review. If anybody writes a good review, please take a screenshot and email it to us. notrightpodcast@gmail.com - because we will get a kick out of that. It'll help our egos, you know, whatever, but it's important that you write something, but I'm not going to go on there and read it because I just don't want to see people say mean things about me.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> It's stressful on earth right now as is.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Oh my God. Seriously.</p>

  <p class="marker">[BUMPER]</p>

  <p class="marker">[AD BREAK]</p>

  <p class="marker">[BUMPER]</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> The only other thing that I wanted to bring up ahead of this episode coming out is, as of today, the Patreon is not live yet. I've got a lot going on in the next few days, but I hope to get it live and ready by that time. I don't know if I will have the tiers with the physical rewards up yet. Anybody who follows me on Instagram may have seen, I've made- I've only got a few of 'em right now. Depending on how it does, maybe I'll make some more- I've made motel keychains with our logo. So those are gonna be a physical reward.</p>

  <p>There are stickers. And I may not have those ready to put up yet, so whatever tier those are at, if you've signed up and they're not on there yet, and you happen to have signed up at a level that I later add with a physical reward, I will get in touch with you and get your address so I can send that sticker or keychain to you.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> It's funny 'cause anytime it would sort of come up in our conversations about doing it again, there was always this part of me that honestly, I didn't really want to do true crime anymore either so I can't begin to tell you that when you said that what a relief it was.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> It's like when somebody cancels plans and you're like, I didn't want to go out anyway.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Well, because I enjoy doing this with you but the truth is is that - and you did way more of them than I did - but anytime I did research episodes, and I've said this before, I'm like, it's really taxing. I enjoy- cause I'm like, you and I are similar in this degree, I love going down like holes and seeing how things connect and learning about stuff.</p>

  <p>It's taxing emotionally, like reading this stuff and like looking at the, the few times like there were, you know, a handful of ones, like when I did the Dorothy Stratten one. I actually found all the photos and like seeing those pictures, it was really upsetting. That episode specifically, I don't regret doing because now there's been all kinds of stuff about her.</p>

  <p>But I feel like at the time there hadn't been a lot of discussion about her other than like the movies from back in the day and, you know, that kind of stuff. But all that's to say it's really taxing, one. Two, even though I'm not in it, I definitely already started to see what you were talking about the exploitation, about so many people doing it.</p>

  <p>And it just- because I always felt like we had the most fun when we were being conversational and being ourselves. That's hard to do sometimes when you're serious.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah. When you're dealing with something that heavy.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I don't know if I ever told you that, that I was very relieved when you told me that. I was like, Oh, good. I didn't really want to do true crime anymore either.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Well, one thing I forgot to mention, cause I went on and on about not wanting to do true crime is I didn't really say anything about what we _do_ have in terms of episodes. And basically what I've gone down the rabbit hole of is not just paranormal stuff, but like weird stuff, odd stuff, just strange happenings, but definitely some paranormal stuff.</p>

  <p>We've got a listener stories episode that we haven't recorded yet,</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Oh I'm looking forward to that.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah. We only have a couple of stories. You know what I would love to do those all the time. I listen to a podcast called, National Park After Dark, and every week or every other week they have an extra episode where they just read stuff that listeners have sent in - like stories of things people have encountered in the outdoors - and I love listening to listener stories.</p>

  <p>Hopefully they're better writers than I am and, so please, if you guys feel like you have a weird paranormal story or maybe just some crazy thing you experienced, send it in to us. You can send it in through the website. The link the website, it's going to be anywhere in our social media, in the notes on the episode, I actually lost the old website 'cause I couldn't pay for it.</p>

  <p>So I've just got it up on WordPress right now. So I don't have a, I don't know if I still have access to the domain name or not, but I don't even have the domain name, so you know, I can't remember what it is off the top of my head, but it's easy to find. And there's a form, you can send it that way or you can email it to us, but send us those stories because I really love those.</p>

  <p>And also it's like, then you do our work for us.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I actually really agree with you on that. That's some of my favorite stuff to do. And I do hope that we get to do more of it. And like I said earlier, I only listen to a handful of podcasts and some of the few that I listen to, like probably the only true crime one - I listen to the Dateline podcast.</p>

  <p>But I listen to several podcasts that are basically just people reading true stories- quotations around true, because you never know. Sometimes I hear some of them and I'm like, I think maybe this is made up, but it was still really entertaining, so I don't care. And then one of the only ones that's not like that, there's this one that I listen to that's called Radio Rental. Have you ever heard of that?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I have heard of it. It's been recommended, but I haven't actually listened to it.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> So I really love it, and Rainn Wilson like hosts it as this fictitious character that runs a video store. But how theirs is different is the people who these stories actually happen to tell them. Like they're talking. I guess they find their stories online and then reach out to 'em and say "Hey, can we just have you record the story?"</p>

  <p>But I love it because it's a mix of everything from like paranormal stuff to- like one of the stories is about- do you remember the plane that had to like emergency land that was coming from France and the guy tried to like set his shoes on fire or whatever? One of the stories is a guy who was on that plane, telling the story about what happened. See I like that kind of stuff.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Sure. And it's good to know why you have to take your fucking shoes off at the airport now.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> It's like my least favorite part.</p>

  <p>But yeah, so I would love to do, not, not exactly like what I just described, but it's very similar in that it's listener submitted stories. So, I highly encourage people to send us stuff.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Please do. And if you think it's stupid, like, it's probably not. So just send it anyway.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> And I encourage people, I mean, obviously send what you're comfortable with.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Sure.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> But like, anything that's either weird or scary. I mean, honestly, if there's something scary that happened to you that you feel comfortable sharing, I wouldn't even be opposed to that. It's definitely more entertaining when it's like, "I went to this old house and then this crazy thing happened."</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Or, you know, like hauntings and Stuff like that.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Weird shit you found.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Yeah, like a haunted object or, it could even be like a pleasant, I don't even mind like, "Hey, my grandma passed away and then this stuff happened."</p>

  <p>I like stuff like that.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Yeah, and those things can be, you just never know who's gonna hear that and find that really comforting too.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> Oh 100 percent. Did you ever watch Celebrity Ghost Stories?</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> I am pretty sure I did watch some of that. It was a long time ago, though.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> I love it because some of the ghost stories would be very like heartwarming. Like, oh, my, my dad came to talk to me or whatever. Joan Rivers has a really good one about after her husband died, she moved into this old apartment and at first it was really scary, but then, like, she made nice, and it was the ghost of this woman that used to live in the building and ran, like, a dance hall type place, and, like, she put a picture of the woman up and, you know, she talks to her every day.</p>

  <p>And then there's ones that are genuinely really terrifying. Like, freaky ghost stories. Like, scary. But, yeah. Send us stuff like that. You don't have to be a celebrity to have a good ghost story.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> It's true. Well, I guess that's all I've got.</p>

  <p>Well, then, goodbye everybody and tune in. We've got an episode coming out. I don't know when I'm gonna get this edited and out, but on Tuesday the 19th of March.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Olivia:</span> Hopefully if somebody's hearing this they're already subscribed, but if you're not, just subscribe or follow the show and it'll come right into your phone.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker_label">Thashana:</span> All right. Bye.</p>
