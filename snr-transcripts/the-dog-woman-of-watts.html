  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Let's dive into this weird tale from 1961. It takes place in Watts, which is, as you may know, a neighborhood in Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>Picture it. Sicily, no, Watts, 1961. It's a sweltering summer afternoon, and the whole community is buzzing with excitement and confusion. The Watts Police Station is flooded with reports of a bizarre creature roaming around East 103rd and Grape Streets. People are calling in, freaked out and curious about what the fuck is going on.</p>

  <p>The sightings of this mysterious creature start around 3:00 PM and go on for a good three to four hours. So that's a lot of time for people to be scratching their heads and trying to make sense of what they're seeing. So what does this creature look like? Well, it's like a mashup of a big dog and a woman - a dog body with a woman's face.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Whoa.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> I skipped out on the title of our story today, which is The Dog Woman of Watts. One LAPD officer talked to a local newspaper sharing that witnesses were describing this creature as a hairy beast that ran around on all fours.</p>

  <p>So this was quite the sight. In the most extensive piece of source material that I could get my hands on - it was a blog post by someone named Kevin Wikse - Wikse recounted a story told to him by a man who claimed to be a witness to this thing. So this man is minding his own business, walking home from work when he hears a lady scream. Naturally he looks in her direction.</p>

  <p>Here we go again with people hearing screams.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Yeah.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> And he spots this woman pulling a kid through a gate. And so his immediate thought is that the kid must have gotten himself into some kind of trouble. And so he kinda laughs to himself about it. You know, he thinks it's just a kid whose mom's pissed, but not so fast - 'cause this is where the story takes a sharp turn.</p>

  <p>As this guy continues walking, he notices the woman and the kid pointing frantically across the street and his eyes sort of follow their gaze and what he sees makes his jaw drop. There's this big ass dog, but not an ordinary dog as we've established. This four-legged creature has a face that's - he described it as being more ape-like than dog-like. A lot of people said it looked like a human face, but this guy says it's ape-like. But if that's not weird enough, it's got this like - it gets described a lot as like a shuffling walk. Shuffling or stumbling, which that sounds kind of creepy. Do you remember that remake of The House on Haunted Hill? And they have those scenes where I'm sure it was filmed backwards and run forwards of the doctor doing that weird walk. That's what I picture, and that's creepy.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Yeah. It's funny. I actually really, I like that remake.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> I do too, up until the CGI shit at the end.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Yeah. And that's just a product of the time. Yeah, and the budget. But like, 'cause there was sort of like a, a few of them at that time. 'Cause I, I did not like The Haunting one.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> No. No.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> It just, no. But The House on Haunted Hill one the, the first one. I loved it 'cause I thought everyone was cast really well in it. I really like Geoffrey Rush in the Vincent Price role.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Yeah. And he's kind of got that similar look.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> And it genuinely has stuff in it that's creepy, like what you're talking about. That freaked me out in it. The like slow shuffling. And then when they do the thing where like the people's heads shake really fast and then they stop. It's that whole idea of something that is human - it's almost like it's glitching out like it's trying to act human, but it's not.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Yeah.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> It's, yeah, it really is jarring. But yeah, that shuffle thing, it's really creepy.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> It's like an uncanny valley kind of thing. Yeah.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> It's that, and I know that we've talked before about we don't ever really want to do any stories about the S.W.'s, and that's what I'm gonna call them, but I read a lot about them and that's how people describe those too. It's always something that almost is what it's imitating and it'll do something like that where it's not quite meeting the mark.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Well, anyway, that's kind of what I picture when they describe this shuffling gate that this thing had. So the guy that witnesses all of this, he's obviously really scared so he quickly crosses the street. And luckily for him, the woman with the child, she opens the gate for him to let him sort of seek refuge in there with them. And so together, he and the woman and the child huddle behind the gate watching this thing kind of mosey on by like they're not even there, doing its weird shuffle. And they're all really freaked out. So they reported it to the police and that's where it kind of leaves off for that sighting.</p>

  <p>But wait! there's more. The man who witnessed all of this told Wikse, the guy with the blog, about some rumors he heard about the dog woman having a chat with a local pimp.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> I can't believe Rudy Ray Moore didn't make a movie of this.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Oh my god. Amazing. I wish!</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> He should've! Right?</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> We gotta invent some sort of time machine and go back and make that happen.</p>

  <p>So that pimp that was having a chat with the dog woman, he wound up stabbed to death, and the man who told Wikse about it felt like maybe there was some sort of connection between the interaction between the creature and the pimp. As we see with these kind of stories, there's zero evidence of any of this as far as I could tell. I mean as far as this murder with this pimp guy. But it adds another weird layer to this very bizarre story.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Wikse also presented some theories about the dog woman. He wondered if this creature had any connection to the legends of the Yokut tribe, an indigenous community with stories and artwork featuring a wolf-bodied ape-faced being. These stories were around long before Europeans showed up. The Wolf Ape stories seemed to be primarily centered around the Watts Valley, which is no relation to the LA neighborhood. This is in California's Fresno County. Wikse said that according to the Yokut, this Wolf Ape always seemed to be under the weather, coughing and wheezing in particular, which is a little strange- a coughing animal.</p>

  <p>As time went on, there were fewer and fewer sightings of this creature, even before those Europeans set foot on the land. But during the California Gold Rush between 1848 and 1855, encounters with the Wolf Ape by Europeans started popping up left and right. According to Wikse, the Wolf Ape's reach goes way beyond Fresno County, though. Reports of sightings have surfaced as far north as Oregon and as distant as Arizona - which Arizona is next to us, but that's a long way off.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Sure.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> The thought being that the Wolf Ape was covering massive distances. Witnesses described its movement as a natural kind of stumbling around, so that fits right in with the Yokut's idea of this everlasting ailment, but also, that kind of weird stumbling, shuffling gate that sighting from the beginning talked about.</p>

  <p>So to tie this back into LA's Watts, which is 250-ish miles south of Fresno. Wikse wondered if the Wolf Ape was the same creature as our dog woman. The sightings in Oregon and Arizona give us some food for thought. If this thing exists, it knows how to roam and transcend pretty massive geographical boundaries. So that's one idea.</p>

  <p>And let's talk about some other theories. Wikse goes down this rabbit hole of human/animal genetic experimentation. That's interesting territory. He mentions the infamous CIA experiments and MK Ultra. I think I've mentioned this on the show in the past - I'm not one to dive headfirst into wild conspiracy theories. I think those kind of outlandish ideas can lead to real life danger, which is something we've seen play out more and more lately.</p>

  <p>But let's say hypothetically that these experiments were real. It breaks my heart to say this, but I wouldn't be surprised if they targeted people of color as test subjects. And Watts has historically been a black neighborhood. It's predominantly Latino now, but if it was gonna happen that way somewhere, you could sort of see that being there. So it's a messed up thought, but unfortunately history has kind of shown us how cruel people can be.</p>

  <p>That said, do I believe this sort of experimentation is happening? No, I do not. I don't think people are breeding dog-humans.</p>

  <p>Wikse also explores this rumor about the dog woman and the local pimp. Since Watts was home to a vibrant black community back in 1961, Wikse asserts that various spiritual practices like Voodoo, Orisha worship, and Palo Mayombe were present. And according to Wikse, these belief systems involve calling upon spirits for retribution on behalf of their followers. In the case of Palo Mayombe, practitioners believed that they could empower human souls with the abilities of animals to carry out tasks. So maybe one of these empowered spirits was sent to seek justice for those who were wronged by this pimp. I mean, I can sort of see that, but we're not talking about an animal with a human spirit. We're talking about a hybrid animal-person. So that seems a little different, but I don't know. It's interesting.</p>

  <p>So there's some other complications with this theory. First of all, the dog woman appeared in physical form witnessed by many, and usually when we think of spirits, they're apparitions and they're only seen by a few people. Maybe they're not even solid. It's not a perfect match.</p>

  <p>But I do wanna touch on another theory from Wikse. He talks about this idea that the dog woman might be connected to a specific Navajo legend. And as you kind of brought up before and this is something I'm going to do out of respect for the Navajo people - I'm not gonna mention the name or really delve into it any further because from what I understand, it's not something they want outsiders discussing. If other people are gonna go down that road, they can, but luckily Wikse mostly discounts that particular idea because LA was home to the Chumash and Tongva people, not the Navajo. So I'm not sure why that legend would even have a place here.</p>

  <p>But there you have it. That's the tale of the Dog Woman of Watts, and as I mentioned before, it's not really a beginning, middle, and end situation. Just this weird thing that happened one day in the sixties. And it really leaves us with more questions than answers.</p>

  <p>But I wanna touch on what I believe on this, and maybe what you believe. I find cryptids fun and I love reading about them, but I have a really, really hard time as far as actually believing there are large creatures that haven't been documented by science at this point, except maybe in the ocean. I feel like somebody would've caught a photo of something. But I don't think these witnesses in Watts made up the story. I think they saw something. Maybe some kind of animal, but maybe it was something that was sick or had some kind of deformity.</p>

  <p>I mean, Lord knows my mom has a dog, Dobby, who- anybody that follows my social media has probably seen him, and he came from another similar-looking dog named Chupey, and Chupey gets his name from the chupacabra. You know, somebody might see Chupey out there or see Dobby and think, "Oh, this is some sort of cryptid 'cause it's unusual looking," so maybe it was something like that. And it looked so unusual they didn't just automatically think it was like a regular dog or coyote.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm with you. I like the idea of of cryptids and I think sometimes I have to say to myself, "I wish that they were real more than I think that they are."</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Exactly. I love the Mothman.</p> 

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> I think probably the only ones that I think could even be possible is a like Bigfoot type thing.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Yeah. Yeah.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Do I think it's possible that there's something that lives out in the wilderness that is sort of this like in-between like human and ape? I don't know. I mean, I don't wanna say it's, I don't like to say anything's impossible because I don't know it. I've never seen it. But I also don't have proof that it doesn't.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Right, right.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> You know what I'm saying? But with this, I also think about the fact that, I know my mind's blanking on the condition, but there's people who are like, you know, it's like that lycan- thing where they're extremely hairy.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Right. I didn't even think about that.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> And I mean, it's like a documented thing where they're covered in hair. So what if it, I don't know. What if it was someone like that who just had that condition, and stays hidden a lot because it was embarrassing?</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Yeah. I could see that being being reasonable.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> And maybe they just happen to run into it. I mean, my mind goes in all different places. And I think part of that is 'cause I'm a, I like to write stories. So I immediately start thinking about not so much the spirit part, but like the idea of it's this thing that's seeking some sort of revenge against this guy who did bad things.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Yeah. That's a little far out.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> I mean, I like more the idea of imagining that it's like a werewolf woman that is like taking revenge. I don't know. But I do like the whole idea of the story in general. I mean. I kind of almost like that you don't know.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Well, I wanna say to you, I should have, should have maybe mentioned this beforehand, 'cause I don't wanna be totally dismissive - if we have any listeners that have cryptid stories and actually I have one for us to record in the future, not from me, but from from a listener - send them in!</p>

  <p>I'm not gonna make fun of you just because I think there might be some other explanation. I still find it really interesting. And I don't know - maybe you'll change my mind. Who knows?</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Thashana:</cite> Yeah, I mean, I don't know if I were some cryptid, maybe I would say hidden from us too. Like not wanna have anything to do with humans.</p>

  Olivia: And end up in a sideshow. Yeah. And yeah, shit's fucked up. Why would you wanna have anything do with us?</p>
