  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> A quick note before we get started:</p>

  <p>Before we decided we would ultimately like to move away from true crime, we considered just covering unsolved cases as there's not a lot of benefit for victims and their families in rehashing solved cases. During that period, I wrote a few episodes, including some where we revisited past cases.</p>

  <p>The story you're about to hear in this episode is one of those, but it is also a solved case. My reason for including it is that it's brought up so often in connection to two other unsolved cases. Those are the cases of Glenda Marie Sirmans, which we also have revisited. And the case of Kathy Jones, which I covered in my standalone podcast, Flatrock.</p>

  <p>Our revisitation of the Glenda Marie Sirmans case was recent, and if you haven't listened to that yet, you may want to do so before listening to this one.</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> We're going to be talking about Betty Jean Necessary. Unfortunately, as is the case with so many true crime stories, especially older ones, we don't know a lot about her, and as much as I'd like to give you a lot of biographical information on her, I don't have that. But at the time of our story, which is in early 1970, she was 12 years old.</p>

  <p>She was a student in Bloomingdale, which is a neighborhood in Kingsport, Tennessee. Betty Jean was a good student and a good kid, not getting into a lot of trouble, not running away, anything like that.</p>

  <p>Our story begins on February 26th, 1970. Betty Jean was walking home from school with two neighbor girls who were friends of hers. Normally she would walk home with her older sister, but as it happened at this time, Betty Jean's whole family was down with the flu.</p>

  <p>Betty stopped at the neighbor girls' house because they had a newborn niece that she wanted to see. When it was time for her to go home, she actually begged one of those friends to walk home with her because she was really afraid.</p>

  <p>The area that she had to pass through to go home, the way it was described in the newspapers, was that there was a gravel road and it was in a wooded area. So you can kind of imagine how that might be a little bit scary, especially for a child.</p>

  <p>The last sighting of Betty Jean was by another neighbor who saw her headed towards that wooded area at 3:40 p.m. And one thing that was noted in the newspaper is that the spot where she was seen was really only about a hundred yards from her doorstep.</p>

  <p>She didn't get home on time, but her mom wasn't too worried. She just figured that Betty Jean was out playing with her friends. But her concern really grew when Betty Jean didn't get home by dark.</p>

  <p>She called around and also spoke with the mother of the neighbor friends and thought maybe Betty Jean had gone into town with one of them. But when she hadn't gotten home by 9 p.m., she called the police and reported her daughter missing.</p>

  <p>It's also important to note that the newspaper reported Betty Jean's dad said she never stayed out all night without calling and she didn't have any reason to run away. As I mentioned before, the whole family was sick with the flu, and her dad pointed out that she had actually been cooking for the whole family during this time while they were sick, and he really didn't feel like she would have run off when they needed her so much.</p>

  <p>Once Betty was reported missing to authorities, police did search the area where she was last seen. They used some search dogs named Satan and Apache, but they didn't find any trace of her. However, they did find some clues. One thing they found was a fresh tire track, suggesting that whoever may have grabbed her took her away by car.</p>

  <p>Also, her school books were found scattered about 100 yards from that gravel road, and there was a large footprint and just general signs of a struggle, so it did not appear that she went willingly.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, two days after Betty Jean's disappearance, her body was discovered. She was found, bound, gagged, shot four times in the back and once in the abdomen, and it appeared that she had also been sexually assaulted.</p>

  <p>The location where she was found was either a mile or maybe a few miles from her home. The reports on that vary. And she was underneath an outcropping of rock. The way it was described in the newspaper accounts from that time made it sound like it was a shallow cave, possibly formed by a sinkhole.</p>

  <p>Some of Betty Jean's clothing was found about 200 yards from her body, though a good deal of it was still on her or near her, which is something we'll get into a little bit later.</p>

  <p>One thing that was noted by investigators was that this scene was not accessible by car. It seemed like the killer must have had to navigate through barbed wire fences and heavy brush to get her there.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before authorities were talking to someone who would emerge as a suspect. They brought in a young man for questioning. His name was Fred J. Bowen, known to his family and friends as Freddie. He was 25.</p>

  <p>Fred couldn't read or write and had left school after either sixth or tenth grade. Again, reports vary on that. At the time of this incident, Bowen was staying at his in-law's home, which was near where Betty Jean was found. And he'd been staying there since about mid-February. He was in town with his wife. They actually lived in Indianapolis.</p>

  <p>Bowen worked as a house painter and restaurant employee in recent months, but was unemployed at this time.</p>

  <p>There was some criminal activity in his past. He had convictions for burglary in Sullivan County, which is where Kingsport is, in 1957 and 1963. Most notably, he was charged in 1967 with contributing to the delinquency of a minor girl, but was never prosecuted, and no further details were available on that incident. The most logical conclusion I could draw from that is that there was probably some sort of inappropriate contact involved. He had other traffic charges and misdemeanors, but there was nothing violent in his record. A burglary, though, had occurred at Kingsley School during Bowen's stay in Kingsport. And some of the stolen items were actually found in his wife's grandmother's outhouse. And her grandmother lived on the same road as Bowen's in-laws where he was staying, but it was unclear if he was ever charged in that theft. Obviously, that is the least of the worries with this guy.</p>

  <p>After questioning and some more investigation, on March 1st, Bowen was charged with Betty Jean's sexual assault and murder. And at his arraignment, a judge appointed a lawyer for him because Bowen couldn't afford one. And actually, a deputy had to read the affidavit to Bowen about this appointment because as I mentioned before, Bowen couldn't read or write.</p>

  <p>Now, there were a few pieces of information that came up during the investigation, one of which was that police questioned Bowen's wife. They did release her later. They didn't feel like she had anything to do with this, but she reported to police that she got in a fight with him while he was drunk and hit him with her purse. But eventually, whatever was going on, he apologized and they reconciled. This is noteworthy though, because he was characterized as not normally being a heavy drinker. So, this incident seemed like it was a little out of character for him, and it just makes you wonder why on that day of all days, he got drunk.</p>

  <p>Bowen and his wife also had originally planned to return to Indianapolis the same evening on the day that Betty Jean disappeared, but they ended up staying in Kingsport, and it wasn't reported why.</p>

  <p>Some of the investigations, though, did stretch beyond Kingsport.</p>

  <p>For one thing, Nashville detectives actually came up to visit Kingsport to investigate some similarities between this case and the case of Kathy Jones, who was murdered in Nashville in November of 1969 - so not too long before this - and as I mentioned earlier, that's the one that I covered in Flatrock, a standalone podcast, and if that's something that you're interested in looking into, that's a detailed deep dive into Kathy's case.</p>

  <p>Investigators from Nashville didn't release any conclusions on that because they couldn't determine whether or not Bowen could have been in Nashville at that time. It's pretty unlikely though, just because of the distance from where he lived and also clearly his financial resources were pretty limited.</p>

  <p>They also looked into any connection between Bowen and the murder of Glenda Marie Sirmans, which happened in the Knoxville area, actually on the very same day that Kathy Jones was killed. Ultimately, they felt like that was unlikely as far as any connection with Bowen because Glenda and Betty Jean's murders were just different.</p>

  <p>Betty Jean, of course, was shot and Glenda was likely held hostage before she was killed and the method used there was stabbing.</p>

  <p>As the investigation continued, on March 15th, the Kingsport Times-News published an open letter from Betty Jean's parents thanking the community and they closed with a message of forgiveness for the accused and stated that they had a desire to see him treated and prevented from hurting others.</p>

  <p class="marker">[BUMPER]</p>

  <p><cite class="speaker_label">Olivia:</cite> Five months after the murder, Fred Bowen's trial began. He was charged with first degree murder and prosecutors were seeking the death penalty. Bowen pleaded not guilty.</p>

  <p>Newspapers covered a lot of the trial testimony and we'll try to keep this from getting too confusing. It jumps back and forth quite a bit. But we'll make it as linear as we can.</p>

  <p>One standout piece of testimony was when Bowen's wife testified that he actually mentioned to her something about, quote, "killing somebody" just hours after Betty Jean's disappearance. When she was questioned, she said at the time she didn't know what he meant, but she knew now.</p>

  <p>She was also cross-examined about a previous statement she'd made to investigators about Bowen saying he killed someone in self defense and buried them. Now on the stand she denied making this statement and she claimed she signed it under duress.</p>

  <p>She further testified that Bowen left home to do some target shooting around 2 p.m. that day. She said he returned around 4:30. And at that time, she saw him out there just staring at the ground. She also noted that staring blankly was not unusual for him.</p>

  <p>Sometime later that evening, and this would have been during the time when she reported that Bowen was drunk, she said he threatened to shoot out a neighbor's porch light while walking with his brother-in-law. That's significant just in that we can kind of infer from that that he was carrying a gun at that time.</p>

  <p>Several other witnesses also took the stand to testify about Bowen's activity on the day of Betty Jean's disappearance.</p>

  <p>One of those being his mother-in-law, and she reported witnessing Bowen hitting, quote, "something white" against a cinder block in the yard around 4:30 p.m. Again, that was about the time his wife testified that he got home.</p>

  <p>Then a neighbor testified that they saw Bowen throwing, quote, "something white" into a nearby pond. Later, police searched that pond and they discovered a .25-caliber pistol with a shattered white plastic handle.</p>

  <p>Later, an FBI agent matched pieces of the white plastic on the handle of the gun to some pieces of white plastic found on that cinder block. Further, that FBI agent was able to confirm that that pistol was the murder weapon.</p>

  <p>Next up, Bowen took the stand and there wasn't a ton that came out of this segment of his testimony.</p>

  <p>Evidently, at some point during the questioning by police, he confessed, which was a little strange because that hadn't been reported prior to this time, at least as far as what I could find. But he alleged that that confession was coerced, and also that he was not read his Miranda rights.</p>

  <p>Now to contradict that, a sheriff's department investigator also testified that Bowen was read his rights and was not threatened. Ultimately the judge ruled that Bowen's confession or statement was admissible.</p>

  <p>During the trial as you would expect, there was testimony about Betty Jean's body and the details of the assault, and it's not really necessary to go into a lot of minute detail on that. I will give you just some of the basics so you can kind of understand the brutality of this crime. She was found lying face down with the multiple gunshot wounds that we've mentioned.</p>

  <p>As I mentioned before, she was bound and gagged. Now, as far as her clothes, some of the early reporting said some were found a ways away from her, but a lot of it was still on her and just torn and in disarray. There were pieces of her clothes and pieces of a man's t-shirt that were used as part of the bindings and the gag.</p>

  <p>I think some of that shirt was stuffed into her mouth.</p>

  <p>There were injuries on her body that indicated she had been sexually assaulted and the jury was also presented with photos that included her bullet wounds and a deep cut on her forehead that actually revealed some of her skull.</p>

  <p>A Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agent also gave some detailed testimony. He said he interviewed several people, including Bowen's brother-in-law, and after that is when he ordered the arrest of Bowen.</p>

  <p>He said that Bowen was advised of his rights and then gave a statement where he claimed he spent several hours at his half brother's restaurant on the day Betty Jean disappeared. Then that he later went to his wife's grandmother's home and picked up his brother-in-law. Then he claimed that Bowen and his brother-in-law went to the liquor store together where Bowen gave him a $100 bill to buy whiskey.</p>

  <p>I don't know why he's carrying around a $100 bill if he was unemployed, but we've got some other questions about what kind of money he did or didn't have that'll come up a little bit later.</p>

  <p>So Bowen continued to tell the agent that the men drank the whiskey and then later ran into Bowen's wife and that's when they got in the fight that I mentioned earlier where she hit him with the purse. He said that the fight was because he had dirt and mud on his clothes.</p>

  <p>The brother-in-law who also testified added some critical information and differences to this timeline. He said that he actually left Bowen at the restaurant for a while and didn't see him again until 5 p.m. which, just to bring it back up, 4:30 is when his wife said he got home from wherever he'd been and was seen hitting something white on the cinder block and staring blankly.</p>

  <p>So, at that point in time, Bowen's half brother, the one who owned the restaurant, had taken his keys away because he was drunk. So Bowen and the brother-in-law decided to walk from there to the grandmother's house.</p>

  <p>And it was some time during this walk when Bowen told his brother-in-law that he had accidentally shot someone while shooting into some bushes and heard them cry out. Now why he was shooting into bushes, I don't know. I think what we see time and again here with statements that Bowen makes is that they really just don't make a lot of sense.</p>

  <p>He went on to tell his brother-in-law that he checked on the person and that they were dead and then immediately after that He claimed he was joking and told the brother-in-law he was taking it too seriously. It's also worth noting here just because it came up in the testimony that the brother-in-law apparently was familiar with this shallow cave where Betty Jean was found and he said everyone had accused him of being involved, but he denied having any involvement in her abduction and murder.</p>

  <p>Bowen also told the TBI agent that the reason his clothes were dirty was that he was shooting a bow in a field.</p>

  <p>Now just to add to the information about his clothing, his wife and mother-in-law both testified that they did not see any blood on his pants. Whether or not police found any there is unclear. It wasn't reported.</p>

  <p>There were several different statements that Bowen allegedly made to people about the weapon in question. His father-in-law testified that a few days prior to his arrest - so presumably this would have been prior to the murder - Bowen purchased a .25-caliber automatic pistol with a white handle from a local man.</p>

  <p>The father-in-law also said that Bowen claimed he sold it for $50 to a trucker who was headed for New York, but then later he told his half brother he sold it for $45 to a boy at a truck stop. Why you would sell a gun to a child, I don't know.</p>

  <p>The operator of that truck stop testified Bowen attempted to sell him a similar pistol, actually a few days prior to Betty Jean's disappearance. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agent testified that Bowen denied ever owning a .25-caliber pistol.</p>

  <p>The man who sold that pistol to Bowen testified that it exactly like the murder weapon found in the pond. I apologize if that was confusing. One of the big things I wondered when reading all of this was why he would buy a pistol just to almost immediately get rid of it, even before the murder.</p>

  <p>It all makes very little sense.</p>

  <p>Bowen would actually return to the stand to provide further testimony, and in this segment of his testimony, he denied any involvement in the murder and actually claimed that he had an appointment at a jewelry store at the time the crime would have occurred. Now, this is strange. He said he planned to sell $7,000 worth of diamonds.</p>

  <p>He alleged he bought $12,000 worth of diamonds from Indianapolis and had traded and sold $5,000 worth of them in his first week in Kingsport. The jeweler on the other hand, testified that he never saw Bowen on the day of the murder. Now, it's worth noting here - I kind of brought this up before - Bowen was unemployed.</p>

  <p>And before that, he worked as a house painter and a restaurant employee. So, it's really unclear how he could have been in possession of such valuables - how he could have bought $12,000 worth of diamonds to begin with. There's no telling if he was ever in possession of any diamonds, but what does seem clear here is he didn't arrive at a jeweler to sell this stuff at the time that Betty Jean was killed.</p>

  <p>Bowen also testified that he was a former mental health patient. He didn't give a lot of details on that, but he did say that he had had head injuries. It sounded like maybe multiple head injuries. One of those was noted as a fall down 22 stairs. He also mentioned that in the past he had had blackouts. Again, very unclear, but I guess the conclusion we're supposed to draw is that maybe those were a result of those head injuries.</p>

  <p>A Knoxville psychologist testified that they believed Bowen had brain damage from a previous accident or head injury, but the Department of Corrections psychiatrist and their staff said they felt he was legally sane. So, if those head injuries really were an issue - if there was brain damage - the idea that we're supposed to take away from that is that it didn't play a role in this crime. It wasn't a defense.</p>

  <p>Bowen also offered some testimony on the weapon in question. He did admit to buying the pistol. He said he sold it to someone at the truck stop on the morning of the day Betty Jean was killed, so that would have been before the murder, and said he didn't know the identity of the man he sold it to.</p>

  <p>He denied throwing anything into the pond, but he conceded that he couldn't remember everything about that day. As I mentioned before, a lot of his statements and his testimony are just very contradictory and confusing, and I invite you to try and make sense out of it. I really couldn't.</p>

  <p>The medical examiner also gave testimony on Betty Jean's cause of death. We don't need to go into a lot of detail on that. Basically the conclusion was: the sexual assault was apparent based on some of her injuries, and this is really awful, but in spite of the gunshots, those weren't her actual cause of death. Her death resulted because there were blood vessel punctures that caused her to drown in her own blood. It was estimated that she likely died the same afternoon that she disappeared, so it's highly unlikely that she was held captive for any of that period of time when she was missing.</p>

  <p>So, at the trial, a lot of information was presented about Bowen's low IQ and possible brain damage. Apparently, there was maybe some evidence of schizophrenia, and those things were all discussed, but nothing stood out that would affect his competency to stand trial or understand the charges against him.</p>

  <p>There was some additional evidence that was discussed in the trial that ended up mentioned in the newspaper. But they didn't give any detail on this stuff, but it was noted as strongly implicating him, so I wanted to mention it. They apparently had a sweater with blood on it. I don't know if maybe they matched the type to Betty Jean's. And then some boots with soil on them, which I'm not totally sure what that indicates. Maybe the soil seemed to be a close match to soil found at the scene where her body was. But like I said, no details were given on these. They were just kind of marked as significant.</p>

  <p>The prosecutor also addressed Bowen directly with this concise, impassioned account of what he believed happened. He alleged that the assault against Betty Jean was premeditated, that he saw her before and had planned it out. He gave a detailed description of Bowen's actions leading to that murder, and it was a very emotional, angry statement.</p>

  <p>All in all, the trial lasted six days. When the jury returned, they announced that Bowen was guilty of first degree murder and after that, the judge sentenced him to death in the electric chair, which was scheduled for April 26th, 1971. That would be shortly after Bowen's 27th birthday.</p>

  <p>Normally a story like this would end here, but we've got a few more noteworthy things to talk about here. First of all, and this was really unusual, there was an attempted attack on Bowen. When he was being transported to the state prison in Nashville, the car he was in was intentionally boxed in by individuals in two cars.</p>

  <p>Now, the Knoxville police did intervene, and they were able to stop one of those cars. They found weapons in it, but they actually ended up never pressing charges due to lack of evidence. The deputy who was transporting Bowen reported that the inmate looked very scared.</p>

  <p>Now, as a standard, there was an appeals process and that further delayed this execution that was supposed to happen. Interestingly enough, and you may have heard of this in other cases that occurred around this time, the U.S. Supreme Court took the constitutionality of the death penalty under consideration, and the governor ended up halting executions in the state during that process. The Supreme Court, in 1972, actually ruled the death penalty unconstitutional, and at this point, Bowen and 19 other Tennessee death row inmates were re sentenced to 99 year terms.</p>

  <p>I want to point this out so there's no confusion because we know people are still being sentenced to the death penalty: capital punishment was reinstated by the Supreme Court four years later. But those re-sentenced due to the earlier decision could not then be sentenced to death again. That would be considered cruel and unusual.</p>

  <p>There was still some more drama in store for Fred Bowen. On Christmas Eve of 1974, during his incarceration at the state prison in Nashville, a fellow inmate stabbed him 23 times.</p>

  <p>What happened was, Bowen and this other guy, they were on their way to lunch, and apparently, Bowen had sold this other inmate candy and soft drinks on credit, and he was attempting to collect. But I guess the other guy was not interested in paying him, and attacked him with a homemade knife. Now, Bowen did manage to cut the other guy's hand with his own knife, but the guards intervened and subdued everybody. Bowen was seriously injured. I don't know the nature of those injuries, but they were noted as being serious. He was taken to Baptist Hospital for treatment and he ultimately survived.</p>

  <p>On February 26th of 2006, 36 years to the day from Betty Jean's murder, Bowen died in prison.</p>
